<h2><a name="introduction">Preface</a></h2>

<br>
A Critical edition of Tennyson's poems has long been an
acknowledged want. He has taken his place among the English
Classics, and as a Classic he is, and will be, studied, seriously
and minutely, by many thousands of his countrymen, both in the
present generation as well as in future ages. As in the works of
his more illustrious brethren, so in his trifles will become
subjects of curious interest, and assume an importance of which
we have no conception now. Here he will engage the attention of
the antiquary, there of the social historian. Long after his
politics, his ethics, his theology have ceased to be immediately
influential, they will be of immense historical significance. A
consummate artist and a consummate master of our language, the
process by which he achieved results so memorable can never fail
to be of interest, and of absorbing interest, to critical
students.<br>
<br>
I must, I fear, claim the indulgence due to one who attempts, for
the first time, a critical edition of a <b>text</b> so
perplexingly voluminous in variants as Tennyson's. I can only say
that I have spared neither time nor labour to be accurate and
exhaustive. I have myself collated, or have had collated for me,
every edition recorded in the British Museum Catalogue, and where
that has been deficient I have had recourse to other public
libraries, and to the libraries of private friends. I am not
conscious that I have left any variant unrecorded, but I should
not like to assert that this is the case. Tennyson was so
restlessly indefatigable in his corrections that there may lurk,
in editions of the poems which I have not seen, other variants;
and it is also possible that, in spite of my vigilance, some may
have escaped me even in the editions which have been collated,
and some may have been made at a date earlier than the date
recorded. But I trust this has not been the case.<br>
<br>
Of the <a href="#section147">Bibliography</a> I can say no more
than that I have done my utmost to make it complete, and that it
is very much fuller than any which has hitherto appeared. That it
is exhaustive I dare not promise.<br>
<br>
With regard to the <b>Notes and Commentaries</b>, I have spared
no pains to explain everything which seemed to need explanation.
There are, I think, only two points which I have not been able to
clear up, namely, the name of the friend to whom the <a href=
"#section44">The Palace of Art</a> was addressed, and the name of
the friend to whom the <a href="#section87">Verses after reading
a Life and Letters</a> were addressed. I have consulted every one
who would be likely to throw light on the subject, including the
poet's surviving sister, many of his friends, and the present
Lord Tennyson, but without success; so the names, if they were
not those of some imaginary person, appear to be irrecoverable.
The Prize Poem, <a href="#section146">Timbuctoo</a>, as well as
the poems which were temporarily or finally suppressed in the
volumes published in 1830 and 1832 have been printed in the <a
href="#section100">Appendix</a>: those which were subsequently
incorporated in his Works, in large type; those which he never
reprinted, in small.<br>
<br>
The text here adopted is that of 1857, but Messrs. Macmillan, to
whom I beg to express my hearty thanks, have most generously
allowed me to record all the variants which are still protected
by copyright. I have to thank them, too, for assistance in the <a
href="#section147">Bibliography</a>. I have also to thank Mr. J.
T. Wise for his kindness in lending me the privately printed
volume containing the <i>Morte d'Arthur, Dora,</i> etc.<br>

<h2><a name="section1">Introduction</a></h2>

<br>


<h3><a name="section2">Part I</a></h3>

<br>
The development of Tennyson's genius, methods, aims and capacity
of achievement in poetry can be studied with singular precision
and fulness in the history of the poems included in the present
volume. In 1842 he published the two volumes which gave him, by
almost general consent, the first place among the poets of his
time, for, though Wordsworth was alive, Wordsworth's best work
had long been done. These two volumes contained poems which had
appeared before, some in 1830 and some in 1832, and some which
were then given to the world for the first time, so that they
represent work belonging to three eras in the poet's life, poems
written before he had completed his twenty-second year and
belonging for the most part to his boyhood, poems written in his
early manhood, and poems written between his thirty-first and
thirty-fourth year.<br>

The poems published in 1830 had the following title-page:<br>


<blockquote><i>Poems, Chiefly Lyrical, by Alfred

 In 1842 appeared the two volumes which contained, in addition to

poems: &sbquo;<br>

<h2><a name="section6">alterations</a></h2>

<br>
Only two of these poems had been published before, namely, <i>St.
Agnes</i>, which was printed in <i>The Keepsake</i> for 1837, and
<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> in <i>The Day Dream</i>, which was
adopted with some alterations from the 1830 poem, and only one of
these poems was afterwards suppressed, <i>The Skipping Rope</i>,
which was, however, allowed to stand till 1851. In 1843 appeared
the second edition of these poems, which is merely a reprint with
a few unimportant alterations, and which was followed in 1845 and
in 1846 by a third and fourth edition equally unimportant in
their variants, but in the fourth <i>The Golden Year</i> was
added. In the next edition, the fifth, 1848, <i>The Deserted
House</i> was included from the poems of 1830. In the sixth
edition, 1850, was included another poem, <i>To &shy; , after
reading a Life and Letters</i>, reprinted, with some alterations,
from the <i>Examiner</i> of 24th March, 1849.<br>
<br>
The seventh edition, 1851, contained important additions. <br>
<br>
First the Dedication to the Queen, <br>
then <i>Edwin Morris</i>, <br>
the fragment of <i>The Eagle</i>, <br>
and the stanzas, "Come not when I am dead," first printed in
<i>The Keepsake</i> for 1851, under the title of <i>Stanzas</i>.
<br>
In this edition the absurd trifle <i>The Skipping Rope</i> was
excised and finally cancelled. <br>
In the eighth edition, 1853, <i>The Sea-Fairies,</i> though
greatly altered, was included from the poems of 1830, <br>
and the poem <i>To E. L. on his Travels in Greece</i> was added.
<br>
This edition, the eighth, may be regarded as the final one.
Nothing afterwards of much importance was added or subtracted,
and comparatively few alterations were made in the text from that
date to the last collected edition in 1898.<br>
<br>
All the editions up to, and including, that of 1898 have been
carefully collated, so that the student of Tennyson can follow
step by step the process by which he arrived at that perfection
of expression which is perhaps his most striking characteristic
as a poet. And it was indeed a trophy of labour, of the
application "of patient touches of unwearied art". Whoever will
turn, say to <i>The Palace of Art</i>, to <i>OEnone</i>, to the
<i>Dream of Fair Women</i>, or even to <i>The Sea-Fairies</i> and
to <i>The Lady of Shalott</i>, will see what labour was expended
on their composition. Nothing indeed can be more interesting than
to note the touches, the substitution of which measured the whole
distance between mediocrity and excellence. Take, for example,
the magical alteration in the couplet in the <i>Dream of Fair
Women</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>One drew a sharp knife thro' my tender throat<br>
 Slowly, &shy; and nothing more,</blockquote>

into<br>


<blockquote>The bright death quiver'd at the victim's throat;<br>
 Touch'd; and I knew no more.</blockquote>

Or, in the same poem: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>What nights we had in Egypt! I could hit<br>
 His humours while I cross'd him. O the life<br>
 I led him, and the dalliance and the wit,</blockquote>

into<br>


<blockquote>We drank the Libyan Sun to sleep, and lit<br>
 Lamps which outburn'd Canopus. O my life<br>
 In Egypt! O the dalliance and the wit,<br>
 The flattery and the strife.</blockquote>

Or, in <i>Mariana in the South</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>She mov'd her lips, she pray'd alone,<br>
 She praying, disarray'd and warm<br>
 From slumber, deep her wavy form<br>
 In the dark lustrous mirror shone,</blockquote>

into

<blockquote>Complaining, "Mother, give me grace<br>
 To help me of my weary load".<br>
 And on the liquid mirror glow'd<br>
 The clear perfection of her face.</blockquote>

How happy is this slight alteration in the verses <i>To J. S.</i>
which corrects one of the falsest notes ever struck by a poet:
&shy; <br>


<blockquote>A tear<br>
 Dropt on <i>my tablets</i> as I wrote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A tear<br>
 Dropt on <i>the letters</i> as I wrote.</blockquote>

or where in <i>Locksley Hall</i> a splendidly graphic touch of
description is gained by the alteration of "<i>droops</i> the
trailer from the crag" into "<i>swings</i> the trailer".<br>
<br>
So again in <i>Love and Duty</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Should my shadow cross thy thoughts<br>
 Too sadly for their peace, <i>so put it back</i>.<br>
 For calmer hours in memory's darkest hold,</blockquote>

where by altering "so put it back" into "remand it thou," a
somewhat ludicrous image is at all events softened.<br>
<br>
What great care Tennyson took with his phraseology is curiously
illustrated in <i>The May Queen</i>. In the 1842 edition "Robin"
was the name of the May Queen's lover. In 1843 it was altered to
"Robert," and in 1845 and subsequent editions back to
"Robin".<br>
<br>
Compare, again, the old stanza in <i>The Miller's Daughter</i>:
&shy; <br>


<blockquote>How dear to me in youth, my love,<br>
 Was everything about the mill;<br>
 The black and silent pool above,<br>
 The pool beneath it never still,</blockquote>

with what was afterwards substituted: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>I loved the brimming wave that swam<br>
 Through quiet meadows round the mill,<br>
The sleepy pool above the dam,<br>
 The pool beneath it never still.</blockquote>

Another most felicitous emendation is to be found in <i>The
Poet</i>, where the edition of 1830 reads: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And in the bordure of her robe was writ<br>
 Wisdom, a name to shake<br>
Hoar anarchies, as with a thunderfit.</blockquote>

This in 1842 appears as: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And in her raiment's hem was trac'd in flame<br>
 Wisdom, a name to shake<br>
All evil dreams of power &shy; a sacred name.</blockquote>

Again, in the <i>Lotos Eaters</i><br>


<blockquote><i>Three thunder-cloven thrones of oldest
snow</i><br>
Stood sunset-flushed</blockquote>

is changed into<br>


<blockquote><i>Three silent pinnacles of aged
snow</i>.</blockquote>

So in <i>Will Waterproof</i> the cumbrous<br>


<blockquote>Like Hezekiah's backward runs<br>
 The shadow of my days,</blockquote>

was afterwards simplified into<br>


<blockquote>Against its fountain upward runs<br>
 The current of my days.</blockquote>

Not less felicitous have been the additions made from time to
time. Thus in <i>Audley Court</i> the concluding lines ran: &shy;
<br>


<blockquote>The harbour buoy,<br>
With one green sparkle ever and anon<br>
Dipt by itself.</blockquote>

But what vividness is there in the subsequent insertion of<br>


<blockquote>"Sole star of phosphorescence in the
calm."</blockquote>

between the first line and the second.<br>
<br>
 So again in the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> how greatly are imagery
and rhythm improved by the insertion of<br>


<blockquote>Across the ridge, and paced beside the
mere,</blockquote>

between<br>


<blockquote>Then went Sir Bedivere the second time,</blockquote>

and<br>


<blockquote>Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in
thought.</blockquote>

There is an alteration in OEnone which is very interesting. Till
1884 this was allowed to stand: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,<br>
Rests like a shadow, <i>and the cicala sleeps</i>.</blockquote>

No one could have known better than Tennyson that the cicala is
loudest in the torrid calm of the noonday, as Theocritus, Virgil,
Byron and innumerable other poets have noticed; at last he
altered it, but at the heavy price of a cumbrous pleonasm, into
"and the winds are dead".<br>
<br>
 He allowed many years to elapse before he corrected another
error in natural history &shy; but at last the alteration came.
In <i>The Poet's Song</i> in the line &shy; <br>


<blockquote>The swallow stopt as he hunted the
<i>bee</i>,</blockquote>

the "fly" which the swallow does hunt was substituted for what it
does not hunt, and that for very obvious reasons. But whoever
would see what Tennyson's poetry has owed to elaborate revision
and scrupulous care would do well to compare the first edition of
<i>Mariana in the South</i>, <i>The Sea-Fairies</i>,
<i>OEnone</i>, <i>The Lady of Shalott</i>, <i>The Palace of
Art</i> and <i>A Dream of Fair Women</i> with the poems as they
are presented in 1853. Poets do not always improve their verses
by revision, as all students of Wordsworth's text could
abundantly illustrate; but it may be doubted whether, in these
poems at least, Tennyson ever made a single alteration which was
not for the better. Fitzgerald, indeed, contended that in some
cases, particularly in <i>The Miller's Daughter</i>, Tennyson
would have done well to let the first reading stand, but few
critics would agree with him in the instances he gives. We may
perhaps regret the sacrifice of such a stanza as this &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Each coltsfoot down the grassy bent,<br>
 Whose round leaves hold the gathered shower,<br>
Each quaintly folded cuckoo pint,<br>
 And silver-paly cuckoo flower.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section7">Part II &shy; comparison of
editions</a></h2>

<br>
Tennyson's genius was slow in maturing. The poems contributed by
him to the volume of 1827, <i>Poems by Two Brothers</i>, are not
without some slight promise, but are very far from indicating
extraordinary powers. A great advance is discernible in
<i>Timbuctoo</i>, but that Matthew Arnold should have discovered
in it the germ of Tennyson's future powers is probably to be
attributed to the youth of the critic. Tennyson was in his
twenty-second year when the <i>Poems Chiefly Lyrical</i>
appeared, and what strikes us in these poems is certainly not
what Arthur Hallam saw in them: much rather what Coleridge and
Wilson discerned in them. They are the poems of a fragile and
somewhat morbid young man in whose temper we seem to see a touch
of Hamlet, a touch of Romeo and, more healthily, a touch of
Mercutio. Their most promising characteristic is the versatility
displayed. Thus we find <i>Mariana</i> side by side with the
<i>Supposed Confessions</i>, the <i>Ode to Memory</i> with Greek
<img src="TG4.gif" width="102" height="29" alt=
"Greek (transliterated): oi rheontes,"> <i>The Ballad of
Oriana</i> with <i>The Dying Swan</i>, <i>Recollections of The
Arabian Nights</i> with <i>The Poet</i>. Their worst fault is
affectation. Perhaps the utmost that can be said for them is that
they display a fine but somewhat thin vein of original genius,
after deducing what they owe to Coleridge, to Keats and to other
poets. This is seen in the magical touches of description, in the
exquisite felicity of expression and rhythm which frequently mark
them, in the pathos and power of such a poem as <i>Oriana</i>, in
the pathos and charm of such poems as <i>Mariana</i> and <i>A
Dirge</i>, in the rich and almost gorgeous fancy displayed in
<i>The Recollections</i>.<br>
<br>
The poems of 1833 are much more ambitious and strike deeper
notes. Here comes in for the first time that <img src="TG5.gif"
width="69" height="26" alt=
"Greek (transliterated): spondai_otaes,"><img src="TG6.gif"
width="66" height="27" alt="see previous image"> that high
seriousness which is one of Tennyson's chief characteristics
&shy; we see it in <i>The Palace of Art</i>, in <i>OEnone</i> and
in the verses <i>To J. S.</i> But in intrinsic merit the poems
were no advance on their predecessors, for the execution was not
equal to the design. The best, such as <i>OEnone</i>, <i>A Dream
of Fair Women</i>, <i>The Palace of Art</i>, <i>The Lady of
Shalott</i> &shy; I am speaking of course of these poems in their
first form &shy; were full of extraordinary blemishes. The volume
was degraded by pieces which were very unworthy of him, such as
<i>O Darling Room</i> and the verses <i>To Christopher North</i>,
and affectations of the worst kind deformed many, nay, perhaps
the majority of the poems. But the capital defect lay in the
workmanship. The diction is often languid and slipshod, sometimes
quaintly affected, and we can never go far without encountering
lines, stanzas, whole poems which cry aloud for the file. The
power and charm of Tennyson's poetry, even at its ripest, depend
very largely, often mainly, on expression, and the couplet which
he envied Browning,<br>


<blockquote>The little more, and how much it is,<br>
 The little less, and what worlds away,</blockquote>

is strangely applicable to his own art. On a single word, on a
subtle collocation, on a slight touch depend often his finest
effects: "the little less" reduces him to mediocrity, "the little
more" and he is with the masters. To no poetry would the
application of Goethe's test be, as a rule, more fatal &shy;
<b>that the real poetic quality in poetry is that which remains
when it has been translated literally into prose</b>.<br>
<br>
Whoever will compare the poems of 1832 with the same poems as
they appeared in 1842 will see that the difference is not so much
a difference in degree, but almost a difference in kind. In the
collection of 1832 there were three gems, <i>The Sisters</i>, the
lines <i>To J. S.</i> and <i>The May Queen</i>. Almost all the
others which are of any value were, in the edition of 1842,
carefully revised, and in some cases practically rewritten. If
Tennyson's career had closed in 1833 he would hardly have won a
prominent place among the minor poets of the present century. The
nine years which intervened between the publication of his second
volume and the volumes of 1842 were the making of him, and
transformed a mere dilettante into a master. Much has been said
about the brutality of Lockhart's review in the <i>Quarterly</i>.
In some respects it was stupid, in some respects it was unjust,
but of one thing there can be no doubt &shy; it had a most
salutary effect. It held up the mirror to weaknesses and
deficiencies which, if Tennyson did not care to acknowledge to
others, he must certainly have acknowledged to himself. It roused
him and put him on his mettle. It was a wholesome antidote to the
enervating flattery of coteries and "apostles" who were certainly
talking a great deal of nonsense about him, as Arthur Hallam's
essay in the <i>Englishman</i> shows. <a name="far"></a>During
the next nine years he published nothing, with the exception of
two unimportant contributions to certain minor periodicals.   <a
href="#fa">1</a>  <br>
But he was <b>educating</b> himself, saturating himself with all
that is best in the poetry of Ancient Greece and Rome, of modern
Italy, of Germany and of his own country, studying theology,
metaphysics, natural history, geology, astronomy and travels,
observing nature with the eye of a poet, a painter and a
naturalist. Nor was he a recluse. He threw himself heartily into
the <b>life of his time,</b> following with the keenest interest
all the great political and social movements, the progress and
effects of the Reform Bill, the troubles in Ireland, the troubles
with the Colonies, the struggles between the Protectionists and
the Free Traders, Municipal Reform, the advance of the democracy,
Chartism, the popular education question. He <b>travelled</b> on
the Continent, he travelled in Wales and Scotland, he visited
most parts of England, not as an idle tourist, but as a student
with note-book in hand. And he had been submitted also to the
<b>discipline</b> which is of all disciplines the most necessary
to the poet, and without which, as Goethe says, "he knows not the
heavenly powers": he had "ate his bread in sorrow". The death of
his father in 1831 had already brought him face to face, as he
has himself expressed it, with the most solemn of all mysteries.
In 1833 he had an awful shock in the sudden death of his friend
Arthur Hallam, "an overwhelming sorrow which blotted out all joy
from his life and made him long for death". He had other minor
troubles which contributed greatly to depress him, &shy; the
breaking up of the old home at Somersby, his own poverty and
uncertain prospects, his being compelled in consequence to break
off all intercourse with Miss Emily Selwood. It is possible that
<i>Love and Duty</i> may have reference to this sorrow; it is
certain that <i>The Two Voices</i> is autobiographical.<br>
<br>
Such was his education between 1832 and 1842, and such the
influences which were moulding him, while he was slowly evolving
<i>In Memoriam</i> and the poems first published in the latter
year. To the revision of the old poems he brought tastes and
instincts cultivated by the critical study of all that was best
in the poetry of the world, and more particularly by a
familiarity singularly intimate and affectionate with the
masterpieces of the ancient classics; he brought also the skill
of a practised workman, for his diligence in production was
literally that of Sir Joshua Reynolds in the sister art &shy;
<i>nulla dies sine line&rsquo;</i>. Into the composition of the
new poems all this entered. He was no longer a trifler and a
Hedonist. As Spedding has said, his former poems betrayed "an
over-indulgence in the luxuries of the senses, a profusion of
splendours, harmonies, perfumes, gorgeous apparel, luscious meals
and drinks, and creature comforts which rather pall upon the
sense, and make the glories of the outward world to obscure a
little the world within". Like his own <i>Lady of Shalott</i>, he
had communed too much with shadows. But the serious poet now
speaks. He appeals less to the ear and the eye, and more to the
heart. The sensuous is subordinated to the spiritual and the
moral. He deals immediately with the dearest concerns of man and
of society. He has ceased to trifle. The the <img src="TG5.gif"
width="69" height="26" alt=
"Greek (transliterated): spondai_otaes,"><img src="TG6.gif"
width="66" height="27" alt="see previous image"> the high
seriousness of the true poet, occasional before, now pervades and
enters essentially into his work. It is interesting to note how
many of these poems have direct didactic purpose. How solemn is
the message delivered in such poems as <i>The Palace of Art</i>
and <i>The Vision of Sin</i>, how noble the teaching in <i>Love
and Duty</i>, in <i>OEnone</i>, in <i>Godiva</i>, in
<i>Ulysses</i>; to how many must such a poem as <i>The Two
Voices</i> have brought solace and light; how full of salutary
lessons are the political poems <i>You ask me, why, though ill at
ease</i> and <i>Love thou thy Land</i>, and how noble is their
expression! And, even where the poems are less directly didactic,
it is such refreshment as busy life needs to converse with them,
so pure, so wholesome, so graciously human is their tone, so
tranquilly beautiful is their world. Who could lay down <i>The
Miller's Daughter, Dora, The Golden Year, The Gardener's
Daughter, The Talking Oak, Audley Court, The Day Dream</i>
without something of the feeling which Goethe felt when he first
laid down <i>The Vicar of Wakefield?</i> In the best lyrics in
these volumes, such as <i>Break, Break</i>, and <i>Move
Eastward</i>, <i>Happy Earth</i>, the most fastidious of critics
must recognise flawless gems. In the two volumes of 1842 Tennyson
carried to perfection all that was best in his earlier poems, and
displayed powers of which he may have given some indication in
his cruder efforts, but which must certainly have exceeded the
expectation of the most sanguine of his rational admirers. These
volumes justly gave him the first place among the poets of his
time, and that supremacy he maintained &shy; in the opinion of
most &shy; till the day of his death. It would be absurd to
contend that Tennyson's subsequent publications added nothing to
the fame which will be secured to him by these poems. But this at
least is certain, that, taken with <i>In Memorium</i>, they
represent the crown and flower of his achievement. What is best
in them he never excelled and perhaps never equalled. We should
be the poorer, and much the poorer, for the loss of anything
which he produced subsequently, it is true; but would we exchange
half a dozen of the best of these poems or a score of the best
sections of <i>In Memoriam</i> for all that he produced between
1850 and his death?<br>

<br>
 In surveying these poems two things must strike every one &shy;
their very wide range and their very fragmentary character. There
is scarcely any side of life on which they do not touch, scarcely
any phase of passion and emotion to which they do not give
exquisite expression. Take the love poems: compare <i>Fatima</i>
with <i>Isabel</i>, <i>The Miller's Daughter</i> with <i>Locksley
Hall</i>, <i>The Gardener's Daughter</i> with <i>Madeline</i>, or
<i>Mariana</i> with Cleopatra in the <i>Dream of Fair Women</i>.
When did love find purer and nobler expression than in <i>Love
and Duty?</i> When has sorrow found utterance more perfect than
in the verses <i>To J.S</i>., or the passion for the past than in
<i>Break, Break, Break</i>, or revenge and jealousy than in
<i>The Sisters?</i> In <i>The Two Voices</i>, <i>The Palace of
Art</i> and <i>The Vision of Sin</i> we are in another sphere.
They are appeals to the soul of man on subjects of momentous
concern to him. And each is a masterpiece. What is proper to
philosophy and what is proper to poetry have never perhaps been
so happily blended. They have all the sensuous charm of Keats,
but the prose of Hume could not have presented the truths which
they are designed to convey with more lucidity and precision. In
that superb fragment the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> we have many of
the noblest attributes of Epic poetry. <i>&euml;none</i> is the
perfection of the classical idyll, <i>The Gardener's Daughter</i>
and the idylls that follow it of the romantic. <i>Sir Galahad</i>
and <i>St. Agnes</i> are in the vein of Keats and Coleridge, but
Keats and Coleridge have produced nothing more exquisite and
nothing so ethereal. <i>The Lotos Eaters</i> is perhaps the most
purely delicious poem ever written, the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
sensuous loveliness, and yet the poet who gave us that has given
us also the political poems, poems as trenchant and austerely
dignified in style as they are pregnant with practical wisdom.
There is the same versatility displayed in the trifles.<br>
<br>
But all is fragmentary. No thread strings these jewels. They form
a collection of gems unset and unarranged. Without any system or
any definite scope they have nothing of that unity in diversity
which is so perceptible in the lyrics and minor poems of Goethe
and Wordsworth. Capricious as the gyrations of a sea-gull seem
the poet's moods and movements. We have now the reveries of a
love-sick maiden, now the picture of a soul wrestling with
despair and death; here a study from rural life, or a study in
character, there a sermon on politics, or a descent into the
depths of psychological truth, or a sketch from nature. But
nothing could be more concentrated than the power employed to
shape each fragment into form. What Pope says of the
<i>Aeneid</i> may be applied with very literal truth to these
poems: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Finish'd the whole, and laboured every part<br>
 With patient touches of unwearied art.</blockquote>

<br>
 In the poems of 1842 we have the secret of Tennyson's eminence
as a poet as well as the secret of his limitations. He appears to
have been constitutionally deficient in what the Greeks called
<i>architektonik&Egrave;</i>, combination and disposition on a
large scale. The measure of his power as a constructive artist is
given us in the poem in which the English idylls may be said to
culminate, namely, <i>Enoch Arden</i>. <i>In Memoriam</i> and the
<i>Idylls of the King</i> have a sort of spiritual unity, but
they are a series of fragments tacked rather than fused together.
It is the same with <i>Maud</i>, and it is the same with <i>The
Princess</i>. His poems have always a tendency to resolve
themselves into a series of cameos: it is only the short poems
which have organic unity. A gift of felicitous and musical
expression which is absolutely marvellous; an instinctive
sympathy with what is best and most elevated in the sphere of
ordinary life, of ordinary thought and sentiment, of ordinary
activity with consummate representative power; a most rare
faculty of seizing and fixing in very perfect form what is
commonly so inexpressible because so impalpable and evanescent in
emotion and expression; a power of catching and rendering the
charm of nature with a fidelity and vividness which resemble
magic; and lastly, unrivalled skill in choosing, repolishing and
remounting the gems which are our common inheritance from the
past: these are the gifts which will secure permanence for his
work as long as the English language lasts.<br>
<br>
In his power of crystallising commonplaces he stands next to
Pope, in subtle felicity of expression beside Virgil. And, when
he says of Virgil that we find in his diction "all the grace of
all the muses often flowering in one lonely word," he says what
is literally true of his own work. As a master of style his place
is in the first rank among English classical poets. But his style
is the perfection of art. His diction, like the diction of Milton
and Gray, resembles mosaic work. With a touch here and a touch
there, now from memory, now from unconscious assimilation,
inlaying here an epithet and there a phrase, adding, subtracting,
heightening, modifying, substituting one metaphor for another,
developing what is latent in the suggestive imagery of a
predecessor, laying under contribution the most intimate
familiarity with what is best in the literature of the ancient
and modern world, the unwearied artist toils patiently on till
his precious mosaic work is without a flaw. All the resources of
rhetoric are employed to give distinction to his style and every
figure in rhetoric finds expression in his diction: Hypallage as
in<br>


<blockquote><i>The pillard dusk</i><br>
 Of sounding sycamores.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Audley Court</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Paronomasia as in<br>


<blockquote>The seawind sang<br>
 <i>Shrill, chill</i> with flakes of foam.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Morte d'Arthur</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Oxymoron as<br>


<blockquote><i>Behold</i> them <i>unbeheld, unheard<br>
 Hear</i> all.<br>
<br>
 (<i>OEnone.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 Hyperbaton as in<br>


<blockquote>The <i>dew-impearled</i> winds of dawn.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Ode to Memory.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 Metonymy as in<br>


<blockquote>The <i>bright death</i> quiver'd at the victim's
throat.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Dream of Fair Women</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 or in<br>


<blockquote>For some three <i>careless moans</i><br>
 The summer pilot of an empty heart.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Gardener's Daughter</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 No poet since Milton has employed what is known as Onomatopoeia
with so much effect. Not to go farther than the poems of 1842, we
have in the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>So all day long the noise of battle <i>rolled<br>
 Among the mountains by the winter sea;</i></blockquote>

<br>
 or<br>


<blockquote><i>Dry clashed</i> his harness in the icy caves<br>
 And <i>barren chasms</i>, and all to left and right<br>
 The <i>bare black cliff clang'd round</i> him, as he bas'd<br>
 His feet <i>on juts of slippery crag that rang<br>
 Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels
&shy;</i></blockquote>

<br>
 or the exquisite<br>


<blockquote>I heard the <i>water lapping on the crag,</i><br>
 And the <i>long ripple washing in the reeds.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 So in <i>The Dying Swan,</i><br>
<blockquote>And <i>the wavy swell of the soughing
reeds.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 See too the whole of <i>Oriana</i> and the description of the
dance at the beginning of <i>The Vision of Sin.</i><br>
<br>
Assonance, alliteration, the revival or adoption of obsolete and
provincial words, the transplantation of phrases and idioms from
the Greek and Latin languages, the employment of common words in
uncommon senses, all are pressed into the service of adding
distinction to his diction. His diction blends the two extremes
of simplicity and artificiality, but with such fine tact that
this strange combination has seldom the effect of incongruity. <a
name="fbr"></a>Longinus has remarked that "as the fainter lustre
of the stars is put out of sight by the all-encompassing rays of
the sun, so when sublimity sheds its light round the sophistries
of rhetoric they become invisible".  <a href="#fb">1</a>  <br>
What Longinus says of "sublimity" is equally true of sincerity
and truthfulness in combination with exquisitely harmonious
expression. We have an illustration in Gray's <i>Elegy</i>.
Nothing could be more artificial than the style, but what poem in
the world appeals more directly to the heart and to the eye? It
is one thing to call art to the assistance of art, it is quite
another thing to call art to the assistance of nature. And this
is what both Gray and Tennyson do, and this is why their
artificiality, so far from shocking us, "passes in music out of
sight". But this cannot be said of Tennyson without reserve. At
times his strained endeavours to give distinction to his style by
putting common things in an uncommon way led him into intolerable
affectation. Thus we have "the knightly growth that fringed his
lips" for a moustache, "azure pillars of the hearth" for
ascending smoke, "ambrosial orbs" for apples, "frayed
magnificence" for a shabby dress, "the secular abyss to come" for
future ages, "the sinless years that breathed beneath the Syrian
blue" for the life of Christ, "up went the hush'd amaze of hand
and eye" for a gesture of surprise, and the like. One of the
worst instances is in <i>In Memoriam</i>, where what is
appropriate to the simple sentiment finds, as it should do,
corresponding simplicity of expression in the first couplet, to
collapse into the falsetto of strained artificiality in the
second: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>To rest beneath the clover sod<br>
 That takes the sunshine and the rains,<br>
 <i>Or where the kneeling hamlet drains<br>
 The chalice of the grapes of God.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 An illustration of the same thing, almost as offensive, is in
<i>Enoch Arden</i>, where, in an otherwise studiously simple
diction, Enoch's wares as a fisherman become<br>


<blockquote>Enoch's <i>ocean spoil</i><br>
 In ocean-smelling osier.</blockquote>

<br>
 But these peculiarities are less common in the earlier poems
than in the later: it was a vicious habit which grew on him.<br>
<br>
But, if exception may sometimes be taken to his diction, no
exception can be taken to his rhythm. No English poet since
Milton, Tennyson's only superior in this respect, had a finer ear
or a more consummate mastery over all the resources of rhythmical
expression. What colours are to a painter rhythm is, in
description, to the poet, and few have rivalled, none have
excelled Tennyson in this. Take the following: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain<br>
 <i>On the bald street strikes the blank day.</i><br>
<br>
 (<i>In Memoriam.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 See particularly <i>In Memoriam</i>, cvii., the lines beginning
"Fiercely flies," to "darken on the rolling brine": the
description of the island in <i>Enoch Arden</i>; but
specification is needless, it applies to all his descriptive
poetry. It is marvellous that he can produce such effects by such
simple means: a mere enumeration of particulars will often do it,
as here: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>No gray old grange or lonely fold,<br>
 Or low morass and whispering reed,<br>
 Or simple style from mead to mead,<br>
 Or sheep walk up the windy wold.<br>
<br>
 (<i>In Memoriam,</i>) c.</blockquote>

<br>
 Or here: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>The meal sacks on the whitened floor,<br>
 The dark round of the dripping wheel,<br>
 The very air about the door<br>
 Made misty with the floating meal.<br>
<br>
 (<i>The Miller's Daughter.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 His blank verse is best described by negatives. It has not the
endless variety, the elasticity and freedom of Shakespeare's, it
has not the massiveness and majesty of Milton's, it has not the
austere grandeur of Wordsworth's at its best, it has not the wavy
swell, "the linked sweetness long drawn out" of Shelley's, but
its distinguishing feature is, if we may use the expression, its
importunate beauty. What Coleridge said of Claudian's style may
be applied to it: "Every line, nay every word stops, looks full
in your face and asks and begs for praise". <a name="fcr"></a>His
earlier blank verse is less elaborate and seemingly more
spontaneous and easy than his later.  <a href="#fc">2</a> <br>
But it is in his lyric verse that his rhythm is seen in its
greatest perfection. No English lyrics have more magic or more
haunting beauty, more of that which charms at once and charms for
ever.<br>
<br>
In his description of nature he is incomparable. Take the
following from <i>The Dying Swan</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Some blue peaks in the distance rose,<br>
 And white against the cold-white sky,<br>
 Shone out their crowning snows.<br>
 One willow over the river wept,<br>
 And shook the wave as the wind did sigh;<br>
 Above in the wind was the swallow,<br>
 Chasing itself at its own wild will,</blockquote>

<br>
 or the opening scene in <i>OEnone</i> and in <i>The Lotos
Eaters</i>, or the meadow scene in <i>The Gardener's
Daughter</i>, or the conclusion of <i>Audley Court</i>, or the
forest scene in the <i>Dream of Fair Women</i>, or this stanza in
<i>Mariana in the South</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>There all in spaces rosy-bright<br>
 Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,<br>
 And deepening through the silent spheres,<br>
 Heaven over Heaven rose the night.</blockquote>

<br>
 A single line, nay, a single word, and a scene is by magic
before us, as here where the sea is looked down upon from an
immense height: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>The <i>wrinkled</i> sea beneath him
<i>crawls</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>The Eagle</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Or here of a ship at sea, in the distance: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And on through zones of light and shadow<br>
 <i>Glimmer away to the lonely deep.</i><br>
<br>
 (<i>To the Rev. F. D. Maurice.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 Or here of waters falling high up on mountains: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Their thousand <i>wreaths of dangling
water-smoke.</i><br>
<br>
 (<i>The Princess.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 Or of a water-fall seen at a distance: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And <i>like a downward smoke</i> the slender
stream<br>
 Along the cliff <i>to fall and pause and fall</i> did
seem.</blockquote>

<br>
 Or here again: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>We left the dying ebb that <i>faintly lipp'd<br>
 The flat red granite.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 Or here of a wave: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Like a wave in the wild North Sea<br>
 <i>Green glimmering toward the summit</i> bears with all<br>
 <i>Its stormy crests that smoke</i> against the skies<br>
 Down on a bark.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Elaine.</i>)<br>
<br>
<br>
 That beech will <i>gather brown</i>,<br>
 This <i>maple burn itself away</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>In Memoriam.</i>)<br>
<br>
<br>
The <i>wide-wing'd sunset</i> of the misty marsh.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Last Tournament.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 But illustrations would be endless. Nothing seems to escape him
in Nature. Take the following: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Like <i>a purple beech among the greens<br>
 Looks out of place</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Edwin Morris</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Or<br>


<blockquote>Delays <i>as the tender ash delays To clothe herself,
when all the woods are green</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>The Princess</i>.)<br>
<br>
<br>
As <i>black as ash-buds in the front of March</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>The Gardener's Daughter</i>).<br>
<br>
<br>
 A gusty April morn<br>
 That <i>puff'd</i> the swaying <i>branches into smoke</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Holy Grail</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 So with flowers, trees, birds and insects: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>The fox-glove <i>clusters dappled bells</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>The Two Voices</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 The sunflower: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><i>Rays round with flame its disk of seed</i>. (<i>In
Memoriam</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 The dog-rose: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><i>Tufts of rosy-tinted snow</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Two Voices</i>.)<br>
<br>
<br>
 A <i>million emeralds</i> break from the <i>ruby-budded
lime</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Maud</i>).<br>
<br>
<br>
 In gloss and hue the chestnut, <i>when the shell<br>
 Divides threefold to show the fruit within</i>.<br>
 (<i>The Brook</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Or of a chrysalis: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And flash'd as those<br>
 <i>Dull-coated</i> things, <i>that making slide apart<br>
 Their dusk wing cases, all beneath there burns<br>
 A Jewell'd harness</i>, ere they pass and fly.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Gareth and Lynette</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 So again: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Wan-sallow, as <i>the plant that feeds itself,<br>
 Root-bitten by white lichen</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Id</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 And again: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>All the <i>silvery gossamers</i><br>
 That <i>twinkle into green and gold</i>.<br>
<br>
 (<i>In Memoriam</i>.)</blockquote>

<br>
 His epithets are in themselves a study: "the
<i>dewy-tassell'd</i> wood," "the <i>tender-pencill'd</i>
shadow," "<i>crimson-circl'd</i> star," the "<i>hoary</i>
clematis," "<i>creamy</i> spray," "<i>dry-tongued</i> laurels".
But whatever he describes is described with the same felicitous
vividness. How magical is this in the verses to Edward Lear:
&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Naiads oar'd<br>
 A <i>glimmering shoulder</i> under <i>gloom</i><br>
 Of <i>cavern pillars</i>.</blockquote>

<br>
 Or this: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>She lock'd her lips: she left me where I stood:<br>
 "Glory to God," she sang, and past afar,<br>
 Thridding the sombre boskage of the wood,<br>
 Toward the morning-star.<br>
<br>
 &shy; <i>A Dream of Fair Women</i>.</blockquote>

<br>
 But if in the world of Nature nothing escaped his sensitive and
sympathetic observation, &shy; and indeed it might be said of him
as truly as of Shelley's <i>Alastor</i><br>


<blockquote>Every sight<br>
 And sound from the vast earth and ambient air<br>
 Sent to his heart its choicest impulses,</blockquote>

<br>
 &shy; he had studied the world of books with not less sympathy
and attention. In the sense of a profound and extensive
acquaintance with all that is best in ancient and modern poetry,
and in an extraordinarily wide knowledge of general literature,
of philosophy and theology, of geography and travel, and of
various branches of natural science, he is one of the most
erudite of English poets. With the poetry of the Greek and Latin
classics he was, like Milton and Gray, thoroughly saturated. Its
influence penetrates his work, now in indirect reminiscence, now
in direct imitation, now inspiring, now modifying, now moulding.
He tells us in <i>The Daisy</i> how when at Como "the rich
Virgilian rustic measure of <i>Lari Maxume</i>" haunted him all
day, and in a later fragment how, as he rowed from Desenzano to
Sirmio, Catullus was with him. And they and their brethren, from
Homer to Theocritus, from Lucretius to Claudian, always were with
him. <a name="fdr"></a>I have illustrated so fully in the notes
and elsewhere  <a href="#fd">3</a>   the influence of the Greek
and Roman classics on the poems of 1842 that it is not necessary
to go into detail here. But a few examples of the various ways in
which they affected Tennyson's work generally may be given.
Sometimes he transfers a happy epithet or expression in literal
translation, as in: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>On either <i>shining</i> shoulder laid a
hand,</blockquote>

<br>
 which is Homer's epithet for the shoulder &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG7.gif" width="132" height="26" alt=
"Greek (transliterated): ana phaidimps omps"><br>
<br>
 (<i>Od</i>., xi., 128.)<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was the red cock <i>shouting</i> to the light,</blockquote>

<br>
 exactly the<br>


<blockquote><img src="TG8.gif" width="152" height="23" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):heos eboaesen alektor"><br>
<br>
 (Until the cock <i>shouted</i>).<br>
<br>
 (<i>Batrachomyomachia</i>, 192.)<br>
<br>
<br>
 And all in passion utter'd a <i>dry</i> shriek,</blockquote>

<br>
 which is the <i>sicca vox</i> of the Roman poets. So in <i>The
Lotos Eaters</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>His voice was <i>thin</i> as voices from the
grave,</blockquote>

<br>
 which is Theocritus' voice of Hylas from his watery grave: &shy;
<br>


<blockquote><img src="TG9.gif" width="148" height="21" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):araia d' Iketo ph_ona"><br>
<br>
 (<i>Thin</i> came the voice).</blockquote>

<br>
 So in <i>The Princess</i>, sect. i.: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And <i>cook'd his spleen</i>,</blockquote>

<br>
 which is a phrase from the Greek, as in Homer, <i>Il</i>., iv.,
513: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG10.gif" width="237" height="21" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):epi naeusi cholon thumalgea pessei"><br>
<br>
 (At the ships he cooks his heart-grieving spleen).</blockquote>

<br>
 Again in <i>The Princess</i>, sect. iv.: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><i>Laugh'd with alien lips,</i></blockquote>

<br>
 which is Homer's (<i>Od</i>., 69-70) &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG11.gif" width="269" height="21" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):did' aedae gnathmoisi gelps_on allotrioisi">
</blockquote>

<br>
 So in <i>Edwin Morris</i> &shy; <br>


<blockquote>All perfect, finished <i>to the finger
nail</i>,</blockquote>

<br>
 which is a phrase transferred from Latin through the Greek;
<i>cf.</i>, Horace, <i>Sat</i>., i., v., 32: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><i>Ad unguem</i><br>
Factus homo<br>
<br>
 (A man fashioned to the finger nail).</blockquote>

<br>
 "The <i>brute</i> earth," <i>In Memoriam</i>, cxxvii., which is
Horace's<br>


<blockquote><i>Bruta</i> tellus.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Odes</i>, i., xxxiv., 9.)</blockquote>

<br>
 So again: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>A bevy of roses <i>apple-cheek'd</i></blockquote>

<br>
 in <i>The Island</i>, which is Theocritus' <img src="TG12.gif"
width="118" height="26" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):maloparaeos">. <br>
<br>
 The line in the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>,<br>
<blockquote>This way and that, dividing the swift
mind,</blockquote>

<br>
 is an almost literal translation of Virgil's <i>Aen.</i>, iv.,
285: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc<br>
<br>
 (And this way and that he divides his swift mind).</blockquote>

<br>
 Another way in which they affect him is where, without direct
imitation, they colour passages and poems as in <i>OEnone</i>,
<i>The Lotos Eaters</i>, <i>Tithonus</i>, <i>Tiresias</i>, <i>The
Death of OEnone</i>, <i>Demeter and Persephone</i>, the passage
beginning "From the woods" in <i>The Gardener's Daughter</i>,
which is a parody of Theocritus, <i>Id.</i>, vii., 139
<i>seq.</i>, while the Cyclops' invocation to Galatea in
Theocritus, <i>Id.</i>, xi., 29-79, was plainly the model for the
idyll, "Come down, O Maid," in the seventh section of <i>The
Princess</i>, just as the tournament in the same poem recalls
closely the epic of Homer and Virgil. Tennyson had a wonderful
way of transfusing, as it were, the essence of some beautiful
passage in a Greek or Roman poet into English. A striking
illustration of this would be the influence of reminiscences of
Virgil's fourth <i>Aeneid</i> on the idyll of <i>Elaine and
Guinevere</i>. Compare, for instance, the following: he is
describing the love-wasted Elaine, as she sits brooding in the
lonely evening, with the shadow of the wished-for death falling
on her: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>But when they left her to herself again,<br>
 Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field,<br>
 Approaching through the darkness, call'd; the owls<br>
 Wailing had power upon her, and she mix'd<br>
 Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms<br>
 Of evening and the moanings of the wind.</blockquote>

<br>
 How exactly does this recall, in a manner to be felt rather than
exactly defined, a passage equally exquisite and equally pathetic
in Virgil's picture of Dido, where, with the shadow of her death
also falling upon her, she seems to hear the phantom voice of her
dead husband, and "mixes her fancies" with the glooms of night
and the owl's funereal wail: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis<br>
 Visa viri, nox quum terras obscura teneret;<br>
 Solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo<br>
 S&aelig;pe queri, et longas in fletum ducere voces.<br>
<br>
(<i>Aen.</i>, iv., 460.)<br>
<br>
(From it she thought she clearly heard a voice, even the accents
of her husband calling her when night was wrapping the earth with
darkness; and on the roof the lonely owl in funereal strains kept
oft complaining, drawing out into a wail its protracted
notes.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Similar passages, though not so striking, would be the picture
of Pindar's Elysium in <i>Tiresias</i>, the sentiment pervading
<i>The Lotos Eaters</i> transferred so faithfully from the Greek
poets, the scenery in <i>OEnone</i> so crowded with details from
Homer, Theocritus and Callimachus. Sometimes we find similes
suggested by the classical poets, but enriched by touches from
original observation, as here in <i>The Princess</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>As one that climbs a peak to gaze<br>
 O'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud<br>
 Drag inward from the deeps, a wall of night<br>
 Blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore.<br>
 ...<br>
 And quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn<br>
Expunge the world,</blockquote>

<br>
 which was plainly suggested by Homer, iv., 275: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG13.gif" width="370" height="83" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):hos d' hot apo skopiaes eide nephos aipolos anaer erchomenon kata ponton hupo Zephuroio i_oaes tps de t' aneuthen eonti, melanteron aeute pissa, phainet ion kata ponton, agei de te lailapa pollaen">
<br>
<br>
 (As when a goat-herd from some hill-peak sees a cloud coming
across the deep with the blast of the west wind behind it; and to
him, being as he is afar, it seems blacker, even as pitch, as it
goes along the deep, bringing with it a great
whirlwind.)</blockquote>

<br>
 So again the fine simile in <i>Elaine</i>, beginning<br>


<blockquote>Bare as a wild wave in the wide North
Sea,</blockquote>

<br>
 is at least modelled on the simile in <i>Iliad</i>, xv., 381-4,
with reminiscences of the same similes in <i>Iliad</i>, xv., 624,
and <i>Iliad</i>, iv., 42-56. The simile in the first section of
the <i>Princess</i>, <br>


<blockquote>As when a field of corn<br>
 Bows all its ears before the roaring East,</blockquote>

<br>
 reminds us of Homer's <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG14.gif" width="316" height="44" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):hos d' ote kinaesae Zephyros Bathulae&Ocirc;on, elthon labros, epaigixon, epi t' aemuei astachuessin">
<br>
<br>
 (As when the west wind tosses a deep cornfield rushing down with
furious blast, and it bows with all its ears.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Nothing could be more happy than such an adaptation as the
following &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Ever fail'd to draw<br>
 The quiet night into her blood,</blockquote>

<br>
 from Virgil, <i>Aen</i>., iv., 530: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Neque unquam Solvitur in somnos <i>oculisve aut
pectore noctem Accipit.</i><br>
<br>
 (And she never relaxes into sleep, or receives the night in eyes
or bosom),</blockquote>

<br>
 or than the following (in <i>Enid</i>) from Theocritus: &shy;
<br>


<blockquote>Arms on which the standing muscle sloped,<br>
 As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,<br>
 Running too vehemently to break upon it.<br>
<br>
 <img src="TG15.gif" width="335" height="65" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):en de mues stereoisi brachiosin akron hyp' _omon estasan, aeute petroi oloitrochoi ous te kylind_on cheimarrhous potamos megalais periexese dinais.">
<br>
<br>
 &shy; <i>Idyll</i>, xxii., 48 <i>seq.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
 (And the muscles on his brawny arms close under the shoulder
stood out like boulders which the wintry torrent has rolled and
worn smooth with the mighty eddies.)</blockquote>

<br>
 But there was another use to which Tennyson applied his accurate
and intimate acquaintance with the classics. It lay in developing
what was suggested by them, in unfolding, so to speak, what was
furled in their imagery. Nothing is more striking in ancient
classical poetry than its pregnant condensation. It often
expresses in an epithet what might be expanded into a detailed
picture, or calls up in a single phrase a whole scene or a whole
position. Where in <i>Merlin and Vivian</i> Tennyson
described<br>


<blockquote>The <i>blind wave feeling round his long sea hall In
silence</i>,</blockquote>

<br>
 he was merely unfolding to its full Homer's <img src="TG16.gif"
width="115" height="21" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):kuma k_ophon"> &shy; "dumb wave"; just as
the best of all comments on Horace's expression, "Vultus nimium
lubricus aspici," <i>Odes</i>, <i>I.</i>, xix., 8, is given us in
Tennyson's picture of the Oread in Lucretius: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>How the sun delights<br>
 To <i>glance and shift about her slippery
sides</i>.</blockquote>

<br>
 Or take again this passage in the <i>Agamemnon</i>, 404-5,
describing Menelaus pining in his desolate palace for the lost
Helen: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG17.gif" width="201" height="41" alt=
"Greek (transliterated):pothoi d' uperpontias phasma doxei dom_on anassein.">
<br>
<br>
 (And in his yearning love for her who is over the sea a phantom
will seem to reign over his palace.)</blockquote>

<br>
 What are the lines in <i>Guinevere</i> but an expansion of what
is latent but unfolded in the pregnant suggestiveness of the
Greek poet: &shy;<br>


<blockquote>And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk<br>
 Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,<br>
 And I should evermore be vex'd with thee<br>
 In hanging robe or vacant ornament,<br>
 Or ghostly foot-fall echoing on the stair &shy;</blockquote>

<br>
 with a reminiscence also perhaps of Constance's speech in
<i>King John</i>, III., iv.<br>
<br>
 It need hardly be said that these particular passages, and
possibly some of the others, may be mere coincidences, but they
illustrate what numberless other passages which could be cited
prove that Tennyson's careful and meditative study of the Greek
and Roman poets enabled him to enrich his work by these
felicitous adaptations.<br>
<br>
<a name="fer"></a>He used those poets as his master Virgil used
his Greek predecessors, and what the elder Seneca said of Ovid,
who had appropriated a line from Virgil, might exactly be applied
to Tennyson: "Fecisse quod in multis aliis versibus Virgilius
fecerat, non surripiendi caus, sed palam imitandi, hoc animo ut
vellet agnosci".  <a href="#fe">4</a><br>
<br>
He had plainly studied with equal attention the chief Italian
poets, especially Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto and Tasso. On a
passage in Dante he founded his <i>Ulysses</i>, and imitations of
that master are frequent throughout his poems. <i>In
Memoriam</i>, both in its general scheme as well as in numberless
particular passages, closely recalls Petrarch; and Ariosto and
Tasso have each influenced his work. <a name="ffr"></a>In the
poetry of his own country nothing seems to have escaped him,
either in the masters or the minor poets.  <a href="#ff">5</a> 
To apply the term plagiarism to Tennyson's use of his
predecessors would be as absurd as to resolve some noble fabric
into its stones and bricks, and confounding the one with the
other to taunt the architect with appropriating an honour which
belongs to the quarry and the potter. Tennyson's method was
exactly the method of two of the greatest poets in the world,
Virgil and Milton, of the poet who stands second to Virgil in
Roman poetry, Horace, of one of the most illustrious of our own
minor poets, Gray.<br>
<br>
An artist more fastidious than Tennyson never existed. As
scrupulous a purist in language as Cicero, Chesterfield and
Macaulay in prose, as Virgil, Milton, and Leopardi in verse, his
care extended to the nicest minuti&aelig; of word-forms. Thus
"ancle" is always spelt with a "c" when it stands alone, with a
"k" when used in compounds; thus he spelt "Idylls" with one "l"
in the short poems, with two "l's" in the epic poems; thus the
employment of "through" or "thro'," of "bad" or "bade," and the
retention or suppression of "e" in past participles are always
carefully studied. He took immense pains to avoid the clash of
"s" with "s," and to secure the predominance of open vowels when
rhythm rendered them appropriate. Like the Greek painter with his
partridge, he thought nothing of sacrificing good things if, in
any way, they interfered with unity and symmetry, and thus, his
son tells us, many stanzas, in themselves of exquisite beauty,
have been lost to us.<br>

<h2><a name="section9">Part IV &shy; Art for Art, Art for
Truth.</a></h2>

<br>
Tennyson's place is not among the "lords of the visionary eye,"
among seers, among prophets, but not the least part of the debt
which his countrymen owe to him is his dedication of his art to
the noblest purposes. At a time when poetry was beginning to
degenerate into what it has now almost universally become &shy; a
mere sense-pampering siren, and when critics were telling us, as
they are still telling us, that we are to understand by it "all
literary production which attains the power of giving pleasure by
its form as distinct from its matter," he remained true to the
creed of his great predecessors. "<b>L'art pour art</b>," he
would say, quoting Georges Sand, "<b>est un vain mot: l'art pour
le vrai, l'art pour le beau et le bon, voila la religion que je
cherche</b>." When he succeeded to the laureateship he was proud
to remember that the wreath which had descended to him was<br>


<blockquote>greener from the brows<br>
 Of him that utter'd nothing base,</blockquote>

<br>
 <a name="fgr"></a>and he was a loyal disciple of that poet whose
aim had been, in his own words, "to console the afflicted, to add
sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier, to teach the
young and the gracious of every age to see, to think, to feel,
and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous".  <a
href="#fg">1</a>  Wordsworth had said that he wished to be
regarded as a teacher or as nothing, but unhappily he did not
always distinguish between the way in which a poet and a
philosopher should teach. He forgot that the didactic element in
a poem should be, to employ a homely illustration, what garlic
should be in a salad, "scarce suspected, animate the whole," that
the poet teaches not as the moralist and the preacher teach, but
as nature and life teach us. He taught us when he wrote <i>The
Fountain</i> and <i>The Highland Reaper, The Leach-gatherer</i>
and <i>Michael</i>, he merely wearied us when he sermonised in
<i>The Excursion</i> and in <i>The Prelude</i>. Tennyson never
makes this mistake. He is seldom directly didactic. Would he
inculcate subjugation to the law of duty &shy; he gives us the
funeral ode on Wellington, <i>The Charge of the Light
Brigade</i>, and <i>Love and Duty</i>. Would he inculcate
resignation to the will of God, and the moral efficacy of
conventional Christianity &shy; he gives us <i>Enoch Arden</i>.
Would he picture the endless struggle between the sensual and the
spiritual, and the relation of ideals to life &shy; he gives us
the <i>Idylls of the King</i>. Would he point to what atheism may
lead &shy; he gives us <i>Lucretius</i>. Poems which are
masterpieces of sensuous art, such as mere aesthetes, like
Rosetti and his school, must contemplate with admiring despair,
he makes vehicles of the most serious moral and spiritual
teaching. <i>The Vision of Sin</i> is worth a hundred sermons on
the disastrous effects of unbridled profligacy. In <i>The Palace
of Art</i> we have the quintessence of <i>The Book of
Ecclesiastes</i> and much more besides. Even in <i>The Lotos
Eaters</i> we have the mirror held up to Hedonism. On the
education of the affections and on the purity of domestic life
must depend very largely, not merely the happiness of
individuals, but the well-being of society, and how wide a space
is filled by poems in Tennyson's works bearing influentially on
these subjects is obvious. And they admit us into a pleasaunce
with which it is good to be familiar, so pure and wholesome is
their atmosphere, so tranquilly beautiful the world in which the
characters move and the little dramas unfold themselves. They
preach nothing, but deep into every heart must sink their silent
lessons. "Upon the sacredness of home life," writes his son, "he
would maintain that the stability and greatness of a nation
largely depend; and one of the secrets of his power over mankind
was his true joy in the family duties and affections." What
sermons have we in <i>The Miller's Daughter</i>, in <i>Dora</i>,
in <i>The Gardener's Daughter</i> and in <i>Love and Duty</i>.
<i>The Princess</i> was a direct contribution to a social
question of momentous importance to our time. <i>Maud</i> had an
immediate political purpose, while in <i>In Memoriam</i> he
became the interpreter and teacher of his generation in a still
higher sense.<br>
<br>
Since Shakespeare no English poet has been so essentially
patriotic, or appealed so directly to the political conscience of
the nation. In his noble eulogies of the English constitution and
of the virtue and wisdom of its architects, in his
spirit-stirring pictures of the heroic actions of our forefathers
and contemporaries both by land and sea, in his passionate
denunciations of all that he believed would detract from
England's greatness and be prejudicial to her real interests, in
his hearty sympathy with every movement and with every measure
which he believed would contribute to her honour and her power,
in all this he stands alone among modern poets. But if he loved
England as Shakespeare loved her, he had other lessons than
Shakespeare's to teach her. The responsibilities imposed on the
England of our time &shy; and no poet knew this better &shy; are
very different from those imposed on the England of Elizabeth. An
empire vaster and more populous than that of the C&Ecirc;sars has
since then been added to our dominion. Millions, indeed, who are
of the same blood as ourselves and who speak our language have,
by the folly of common ancestors, become aliens. But how immense
are the realms peopled by the colonies which are still loyal to
us, and by the three hundred millions who in India own us as
their rulers: of this vast empire England is now the capital and
centre. That she should fulfil completely and honourably the
duties to which destiny has called her will be the prayer of
every patriot, that he should by his own efforts contribute all
in his power to further such fulfilment must be his earnest
desire. It would be no exaggeration to say that Tennyson
contributed more than any man who has ever lived to what may be
called the higher political education of the English-speaking
races. Of imperial federation he was at once the apostle and the
pioneer. In poetry which appealed as probably no other poetry has
appealed to every class, wherever our language is spoken, he
dwelt fondly on all that constitutes the greatness and glory of
England, on her grandeur in the past, on the magnificent promise
of the part she will play in the future, if her sons are true to
her. There should be no distinction, for she recognises no
distinction between her children at home and her children in her
colonies. She is the common mother of a common race: one flag,
one sceptre, the same proud ancestry, the same splendid
inheritance. "How strange England cannot see," he once wrote,
"that her true policy lies in a close union with her
colonies."<br>


<blockquote>Sharers of our glorious past,<br>
Shall we not thro' good and ill<br>
Cleave to one another still?<br>
Britain's myriad voices call,<br>
Sons be welded all and all<br>
Into one imperial whole,<br>
One with Britain, heart and soul!<br>
One life, one flag, one fleet, one Throne!</blockquote>

<br>
 Thus did the poetry of Tennyson draw closer, and thus will it
continue to draw closer those sentimental ties &shy; ties, in
Burke's phrase, "light as air, but strong as links of iron,"
which bind the colonies to the mother country; and in so doing,
if he did not actually initiate, he furthered, as no other single
man has furthered, the most important movement of our time. Nor
has any man of genius in the present century &shy; not Dickens,
not Ruskin &shy; been moved by a purer spirit of philanthropy, or
done more to show how little the qualities and actions which
dignify humanity depend, or need depend, on the accidents of
fortune. He brought poetry into touch with the discoveries of
science, and with the speculations of theology and metaphysics,
and though, in treating such subjects, his power is not, perhaps,
equal to his charm, the debt which his countrymen owe him, even
intellectually, is incalculable.<br>

First printed in 1830. Lord Tennyson tells us (<i>Life of
Tennyson</i>, i., 43) that in this poem his father more or less
described his own mother, who was a "remarkable and saintly
woman". In this as in the other poems elaborately painting women
we may perhaps suspect the influence of Wordsworth's
<i>Triad</i>, which should be compared with them. <br>

<h3><a name="section14">Mariana</a></h3>

<br>
"Mariana in the moated grange." &shy; <i>Measure for
Measure</i>.<br>
<br>
First printed in 1830.<br>
<br>
 This poem as we know from the motto prefixed to it was suggested
by Shakespeare (<i>Measure for Measure</i>, iii., 1, "at the
moated grange resides this dejected Mariana,") but the poet may
have had in his mind the exquisite fragment of Sappho: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG18.gif" width="188" height="66" alt=
"Greek (transliterated): deduke men ha selanna kai Plae&iuml;ades, mesai de nuktes, para d' erchet h_ora ego de mona kateud_o">
<br>
<br>
 "The moon has set and the Pleiades, and it is midnight: the hour
too is going by, but I sleep alone."</blockquote>

<br>
 It was long popularly supposed that the scene of the poem was a
farm near Somersby known as Baumber's farm, but Tennyson denied
this and said it was a purely "imaginary house in the fen," and
that he "never so much as dreamed of Baumbers farm". See
<i>Life</i>, i., 28.<br>


<blockquote>With blackest moss the flower-plots<br>
 Were thickly crusted, one and all:<br>
 <a name="facr"></a>The rusted nails fell from the knots<br>
 <a name="fadr"></a>That held the peach  <a href="#fac">1</a>  to
the garden-wall.  <a href="#fad">2</a><br>
 The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:<br>
 Unlifted was the clinking latch;<br>
 Weeded and worn the ancient thatch<br>
 Upon the lonely moated grange.<br>
 She only said, "My life is dreary,<br>
 He cometh not," she said;<br>
 She said, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 I would that I were dead!"<br>
<br>
 <a name="faer"></a>Her tears fell with the dews at even;<br>
 Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;  <a href=

 She could not look on the sweet heaven,<br>
 Either at morn or eventide.<br>
 After the flitting of the bats,<br>
 When thickest dark did trance the sky,<br>
 She drew her casement-curtain by,<br>
 And glanced athwart the glooming flats.<br>
 She only said, "The night is dreary,<br>
 He cometh not," she said;<br>
 She said, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 I would that I were dead!"<br>
<br>
 Upon the middle of the night,<br>
 Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:<br>
 The cock sung out an hour ere light:<br>
 From the dark fen the oxen's low<br>
 Came to her: without hope of change,<br>
 <a name="fafr"></a> In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,<br>
 Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed  <a href="#faf">4</a> 
morn<br>
 About the lonely moated grange.<br>
 She only said, "The day is dreary,<br>
 He cometh not," she said;<br>
 She said, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 I would that I were dead!"<br>
<br>
 About a stone-cast from the wall<br>
 A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,<br>
 And o'er it many, round and small,<br>
 The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.<br>
 <a name="fagr"></a>Hard by a poplar shook alway,<br>
 <a name="fahr"></a>All silver-green with gnarled bark:<br>
 For leagues no other tree did mark  <a href="#fag">5</a><br>
 The level waste, the rounding gray. <a href="#fah">6</a><br>
 She only said, "My life is dreary,<br>
 He cometh not," she said;<br>
 She said, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 I would that I were dead!"<br>
<br>
 <a name="fair"></a>And ever when the moon was low,<br>
 And the shrill winds were up and away,  <a href="#fai">7</a><br>
 In the white curtain, to and fro,<br>
 She saw the gusty shadow sway.<br>
 But when the moon was very low,<br>
 And wild winds bound within their cell,<br>
 The shadow of the poplar fell<br>
 Upon her bed, across her brow.<br>
 She only said, "The night is dreary,<br>
 He cometh not," she said;<br>
 She said, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 I would that I were dead!"<br>
<br>
 All day within the dreamy house,<br>
 <a name="fajr"></a> The doors upon their hinges creak'd;<br>
 The blue fly sung in the pane;  <a href="#faj">8</a>  the
mouse<br>
 Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,<br>
 Or from the crevice peer'd about.<br>
 Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors,<br>
 Old footsteps trod the upper floors,<br>
 Old voices called her from without.<br>
 She only said, "My life is dreary,<br>
 He cometh not," she said;<br>
 She said, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 I would that I were dead!"<br>
<br>
 The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,<br>
 The slow clock ticking, and the sound,<br>
 Which to the wooing wind aloof<br>
 The poplar made, did all confound<br>
 Her sense; but most she loathed the hour<br>
 When the thick-moted sunbeam lay<br>
 <a name="fakr"></a>Athwart the chambers, and the day<br>
 Was sloping  <a href="#fak">9</a>  toward his western bower.<br>
 Then, said she, "I am very dreary,<br>
 He will not come," she said;<br>
 She wept, "I am aweary, aweary,<br>
 O God, that I were dead!".</blockquote>

The friend to whom these verses were addressed was Joseph William
Blakesley, third Classic and Senior Chancellor's Medallist in
1831, and afterwards Dean of Lincoln. Tennyson said of him: "He
ought to be Lord Chancellor, for he is a subtle and powerful
reasoner, and an honest man". &shy; <i>Life</i>, i., 65. He was a
contributor to the <i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly Reviews</i>,
and died in April, 1885. See memoir of him in the <i>Dictionary

With this poem should be compared the description of Harun al
Rashid's Garden of Gladness in the story of Nur-al-din Ali and
the damsel Anis al Talis in the Thirty-Sixth Night. The style
appears to have been modelled on Coleridge's <i>Kubla Khan</i>
and <i>Lewti</i>, and the influence of Coleridge is very
perceptible throughout the poem.<br>

 From the long alley's latticed shade<br>
 Emerged, I came upon the great<br>
 Pavilion of the Caliphat.<br>
 Right to the carven cedarn doors,<br>
 Flung inward over spangled floors,<br>
 Broad-based flights of marble stairs<br>
 Ran up with golden balustrade,<br>
 After the fashion of the time,<br>
 And humour of the golden prime<br>
 Of good Haroun Alraschid.<br>
<br>
 The fourscore windows all alight<br>
 As with the quintessence of flame,<br>
 <a name="fbhr"></a>A million tapers flaring bright<br>
 From twisted silvers look'd  <a href="#fbh">16</a>  to shame<br>
 The hollow-vaulted dark, and stream'd<br>
 Upon the mooned domes aloof<br>
 In inmost Bagdat, till there seem'd<br>
 Hundreds of crescents on the roof<br>
 Of night new-risen, that marvellous time,<br>
 To celebrate the golden prime<br>
 Of good Haroun Alraschid.<br>
<br>
 Then stole I up, and trancedly<br>
 Gazed on the Persian girl alone,<br>
 Serene with argent-lidded eyes<br>
 Amorous, and lashes like to rays<br>
 Of darkness, and a brow of pearl<br>
 Tressed with redolent ebony,<br>
 <a name="fbir"></a> In many a dark delicious curl,<br>
 Flowing beneath  <a href="#fbi">17</a>  her rose-hued zone;<br>
 The sweetest lady of the time,<br>
 Well worthy of the golden prime<br>
 <a name="fbjr"></a> Of good Haroun Alraschid.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fbkr"></a>Six columns, three on either side,<br>
 Pure silver, underpropt  <a href="#fbj">18</a>  a rich<br>
 Throne of the  <a href="#fbk">19</a>  massive ore, from
which<br>
 Down-droop'd, in many a floating fold,<br>
 Engarlanded and diaper'd<br>
 With inwrought flowers, a cloth of gold.<br>
 Thereon, his deep eye laughter-stirr'd<br>
 With merriment of kingly pride,<br>
 Sole star of all that place and time,<br>
 I saw him &shy; in his golden prime,<br>
 THE GOOD HAROUN ALRASCHID!</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section20">Ode to Memory</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1830.<br>
<br>
 After the title in 1830 ed. is "Written very early in life". The
influence most perceptible in this poem is plainly Coleridge, on
whose <i>Songs of the Pixies</i> it seems to have been modelled.
Tennyson considered it, and no wonder, as one of the very best of
"his early and peculiarly concentrated Nature-poems". See
<i>Life</i>, i., 27. It is full of vivid and accurate pictures of
his Lincolnshire home and haunts. See <i>Life</i>, i., 25-48,
<i>passim</i>.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>1<br>
<br>
 Thou who stealest fire,<br>
 From the fountains of the past,<br>
 To glorify the present; oh, haste,<br>
 Visit my low desire!<br>
 Strengthen me, enlighten me!<br>
 I faint in this obscurity,<br>
 Thou dewy dawn of memory.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <a name="fblr"></a>2<br>
<br>
 Come not as thou camest  <a href="#fbl">1</a>  of late,<br>
 Flinging the gloom of yesternight<br>
 On the white day; but robed in soften'd light<br>
 Of orient state.<br>
 Whilome thou camest with the morning mist,<br>
 <a name="fbmr"></a>Even as a maid, whose stately brow<br>
 The dew-impearled winds of dawn have kiss'd,  <a href=
"#fbm">2</a><br>
 When she, as thou,<br>
 Stays on her floating locks the lovely freight<br>
 Of overflowing blooms, and earliest shoots<br>
 Of orient green, giving safe pledge of fruits,<br>
 Which in wintertide shall star<br>
 The black earth with brilliance rare.<br>
<br>
<br>
 3<br>
<br>
 Whilome thou camest with the morning mist.<br>
 And with the evening cloud,<br>
 Showering thy gleaned wealth into my open breast,<br>
 (Those peerless flowers which in the rudest wind<br>
 Never grow sere,<br>
 When rooted in the garden of the mind,<br>
 Because they are the earliest of the year).<br>
 Nor was the night thy shroud.<br>
 In sweet dreams softer than unbroken rest<br>
 Thou leddest by the hand thine infant Hope.<br>
 The eddying of her garments caught from thee<br>
 The light of thy great presence; and the cope<br>
 Of the half-attain'd futurity,<br>
 Though deep not fathomless,<br>
 Was cloven with the million stars which tremble<br>
 O'er the deep mind of dauntless infancy.<br>
 Small thought was there of life's distress;<br>
 For sure she deem'd no mist of earth could dull<br>
 Those spirit-thrilling eyes so keen and beautiful:<br>
 Sure she was nigher to heaven's spheres,<br>
 <a name="fbnr"></a>Listening the lordly music flowing from<br>
 The illimitable years.  <a href="#fbn">3</a><br>
 O strengthen me, enlighten me!<br>
 I faint in this obscurity,<br>
 Thou dewy dawn of memory.<br>
<br>
<br>
 4<br>
<br>
 Come forth I charge thee, arise,<br>
 Thou of the many tongues, the myriad eyes!<br>
 Thou comest not with shows of flaunting vines<br>
 Unto mine inner eye,<br>
 Divinest Memory!<br>
 Thou wert not nursed by the waterfall<br>
 Which ever sounds and shines<br>
 A pillar of white light upon the wall<br>
 Of purple cliffs, aloof descried:<br>
 <a name="fbor"></a>Come from the woods that belt the grey
hill-side,<br>
 The seven elms, the poplars  <a href="#fbo">4</a>  four<br>
 <a name="fbpr"></a>That stand beside my father's door,<br>
 And chiefly from the brook  <a href="#fbp">5</a>  that loves<br>
 To purl o'er matted cress and ribbed sand,<br>
 Or dimple in the dark of rushy coves,<br>
 Drawing into his narrow earthen urn,<br>
 In every elbow and turn,<br>
 The filter'd tribute of the rough woodland.<br>
 O! hither lead thy feet!<br>
 Pour round mine ears the livelong bleat<br>
 Of the thick-fleeced sheep from wattled folds,<br>
 <a name="fbqr"></a>Upon the ridged wolds,<br>
 When the first matin-song hath waken'd  <a href="#fbq">6</a> 
loud<br>
 Over the dark dewy earth forlorn,<br>
 What time the amber morn<br>
 Forth gushes from beneath a low-hung cloud.<br>
<br>
<br>
 5<br>
<br>
 Large dowries doth the raptured eye<br>
 To the young spirit present<br>
 When first she is wed;<br>
 And like a bride of old<br>
 In triumph led,<br>
 With music and sweet showers<br>
 Of festal flowers,<br>
 Unto the dwelling she must sway.<br>
 Well hast thou done, great artist Memory,<br>
 In setting round thy first experiment<br>
 With royal frame-work of wrought gold;<br>
 Needs must thou dearly love thy first essay,<br>
 And foremost in thy various gallery<br>
 Place it, where sweetest sunlight falls<br>
 Upon the storied walls;<br>
 For the discovery<br>
 And newness of thine art so pleased thee,<br>
 That all which thou hast drawn of fairest<br>
 Or boldest since, but lightly weighs<br>
 With thee unto the love thou bearest<br>
 The first-born of thy genius.<br>
 Artist-like,<br>
 Ever retiring thou dost gaze<br>
 On the prime labour of thine early days:<br>
 No matter what the sketch might be;<br>
 Whether the high field on the bushless Pike,<br>
 Or even a sand-built ridge<br>
 Of heaped hills that mound the sea,<br>
 <a name="fbrr1"></a>Overblown with murmurs harsh,<br>
 Or even a lowly cottage  <a href="#fbr1">7</a>  whence we
see<br>
 Stretch'd wide and wild the waste enormous marsh,<br>
 <a name="fbsr"></a>Where from the frequent bridge,<br>
 Like emblems of infinity,  <a href="#fbs">8</a><br>
 The trenched waters run from sky to sky;<br>
 <a name="fbtr"></a>Or a garden bower'd close<br>
 With plaited  <a href="#fbt">9</a>  alleys of the trailing
rose,<br>
 Long alleys falling down to twilight grots,<br>
 Or opening upon level plots<br>
 Of crowned lilies, standing near<br>
 Purple-spiked lavender:<br>
 Whither in after life retired<br>
From brawling storms,<br>
 From weary wind,<br>
 With youthful fancy reinspired,<br>
 <a name="fbur"></a>We may hold converse with all forms<br>
 <a name="fbvr"></a>Of the many-sided mind,<br>
 And those  <a href="#fbu">10</a>  whom passion hath not

 <a name="fbwr"></a>Subtle-thoughted, myriad-minded.<br>
 My friend, with you  <a href="#fbv">11</a>  to live alone,<br>
 Were how much  <a href="#fbw">12</a>  better than to own<br>
 A crown, a sceptre, and a throne!<br>
 O strengthen, enlighten me!<br>
 I faint in this obscurity,<br>
 Thou dewy dawn of memory.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section21">Song</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1830.<br>
<br>
The poem was written in the garden at the Old Rectory, Somersby;
an autumn scene there which it faithfully describes. This poem
seems to have haunted Poe, a fervent admirer of Tennyson's early
poems.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>1<br>
<br>
 A Spirit haunts the year's last hours<br>
 Dwelling amid these yellowing bowers:<br>
 To himself he talks;<br>
 For at eventide, listening earnestly,<br>
 At his work you may hear him sob and sigh<br>
 In the walks;<br>
 Earthward he boweth the heavy stalks<br>
 Of the mouldering flowers:<br>
 Heavily hangs the broad sunflower<br>
 Over its grave i' the earth so chilly;<br>
 Heavily hangs the hollyhock,<br>
 Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.<br>
<br>
<br>
 2<br>
<br>
 The air is damp, and hush'd, and close,<br>
 As a sick man's room when he taketh repose<br>
 An hour before death;<br>
 My very heart faints and my whole soul grieves<br>
 At the moist rich smell of the rotting leaves,<br>
 And the breath<br>
 Of the fading edges of box beneath,<br>
 And the year's last rose.<br>
 Heavily hangs the broad sunflower<br>
 Over its grave i' the earth so chilly;<br>
 Heavily hangs the hollyhock,<br>
 Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.</blockquote>

<br>
First printed in 1830.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>1<br>
<br>
 Mystery of mysteries,<br>
 Faintly smiling Adeline,<br>
 Scarce of earth nor all divine,<br>
 Nor unhappy, nor at rest,<br>
 But beyond expression fair<br>
 With thy floating flaxen hair;<br>
 Thy rose-lips and full blue eyes<br>
 Take the heart from out my breast.<br>
 Wherefore those dim looks of thine,<br>
 Shadowy, dreaming Adeline?<br>
<br>
<br>
 2<br>
<br>
 Whence that aery bloom of thine,<br>
 Like a lily which the sun<br>
 Looks thro' in his sad decline,<br>

 As a Na&iuml;ad in a well,<br>
 Looking at the set of day,<br>
 Or a phantom two hours old<br>
 Of a maiden passed away,<br>
 Ere the placid lips be cold?<br>
 Wherefore those faint smiles of thine,<br>
 Spiritual Adeline?<br>

 3<br>
<br>
 What hope or fear or joy is thine?<br>
 Who talketh with thee, Adeline?<br>
 For sure thou art not all alone:<br>
 Do beating hearts of salient springs<br>
 Keep measure with thine own?<br>
 Hast thou heard the butterflies<br>
 What they say betwixt their wings?<br>
 Or in stillest evenings<br>
 With what voice the violet woos<br>
 To his heart the silver dews?<br>
 <a name="fbxr"></a>Or when little airs arise,<br>
 How the merry bluebell rings  <a href="#fbx">1</a><br>
 To the mosses underneath?<br>

 Wherefore that faint smile of thine,<br>
 Shadowy, dreaming Adeline?<br>

<br>
 4<br>
<br>
 Some honey-converse feeds thy mind,<br>
 Some spirit of a crimson rose<br>

<h3><a name="section23">A Character</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1830.<br>
<br>
The only authoritative light thrown on the person here described
is what the present Lord Tennyson gives, who tells us that "the
then well-known Cambridge orator S &shy; was partly described".
He was "a very plausible, parliament-like, self-satisfied speaker
at the Union Debating Society ". The character reminds us of
Wordsworth's Moralist. See <i>Poet's Epitaph</i>; &shy; <br>


<blockquote>One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling,<br>
Nor form nor feeling, great nor small;<br>
A reasoning, self-sufficient thing,<br>
An intellectual all in all.</blockquote>

Shakespeare's fop, too (Hotspur's speech, <i>Henry IV.</i>, i.,
i., 2), seems to have suggested a touch or two.<br>
 <br>
<blockquote>With a half-glance upon the sky<br>
 At night he said, "The wanderings<br>
 Of this most intricate Universe<br>
 Teach me the nothingness of things".<br>
 Yet could not all creation pierce<br>
 Beyond the bottom of his eye.<br>
<br>
 He spake of beauty: that the dull<br>
 Saw no divinity in grass,<br>
 Life in dead stones, or spirit in air;<br>
 Then looking as 'twere in a glass,<br>
 He smooth'd his chin and sleek'd his hair,<br>
 And said the earth was beautiful.<br>
<br>
 He spake of virtue: not the gods<br>
 More purely, when they wish to charm<br>
 Pallas and Juno sitting by:<br>
 And with a sweeping of the arm,<br>
 And a lack-lustre dead-blue eye,<br>
 Devolved his rounded periods.<br>
<br>
 Most delicately hour by hour<br>
 He canvass'd human mysteries,<br>
 And trod on silk, as if the winds<br>
 Blew his own praises in his eyes,<br>
 And stood aloof from other minds<br>
 In impotence of fancied power.<br>
<br>
 With lips depress'd as he were meek,<br>
 Himself unto himself he sold:<br>
 Upon himself himself did feed:<br>
 Quiet, dispassionate, and cold,<br>
 And other than his form of creed,<br>
 With chisell'd features clear and sleek.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The poet in a golden clime was born,<br>
 <a name="fcdr"></a>With golden stars above;<br>
 Dower'd with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,  <a href=
"#fcd">1</a><br>
 <a name="fcer"></a>The love of love.<br>
<br>
 He saw thro'  <a href="#fce">2</a>  life and death, thro'  <a
href="#fce">2</a>   good and ill,<br>
 He saw thro'  <a href="#fce">2</a>   his own soul.<br>
 The marvel of the everlasting will,<br>
 An open scroll,<br>
<br>
 Before him lay: with echoing feet he threaded<br>
 The secretest walks of fame:<br>
 The viewless arrows of his thoughts were headed<br>
 And wing'd with flame, &shy;<br>
<br>
 Like Indian reeds blown from his silver tongue,<br>
 And of so fierce a flight,<br>
 From Calpe unto Caucasus they sung,<br>
 Filling with light<br>
<br>
 And vagrant melodies the winds which bore<br>
 Them earthward till they lit;<br>
 Then, like the arrow-seeds of the field flower,<br>
 The fruitful wit<br>
<br>
 Cleaving, took root, and springing forth anew<br>
 Where'er they fell, behold,<br>
 Like to the mother plant in semblance, grew<br>
 A flower all gold,<br>
<br>
 And bravely furnish'd all abroad to fling<br>
 The winged shafts of truth,<br>
 To throng with stately blooms the breathing spring<br>
 Of Hope and Youth.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fcfr"></a>So many minds did gird their orbs with
beams,<br>
 Tho'  <a href="#fcf">3</a>  one did fling the fire.<br>
 Heaven flow'd upon the soul in many dreams<br>
 Of high desire.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fcgr"></a>Thus truth was multiplied on truth, the
world<br>
Like one  <a href="#fcg">4</a>   great garden show'd,<br>
 And thro' the wreaths of floating dark upcurl'd,<br>
 Rare sunrise flow'd.<br>
<br>
 And Freedom rear'd in that august sunrise<br>
 Her beautiful bold brow,<br>
 When rites and forms before his burning eyes<br>
 Melted like snow.<br>
<br>
 There was no blood upon her maiden robes<br>
 Sunn'd by those orient skies;<br>
 But round about the circles of the globes<br>
 Of her keen eyes<br>
<br>
 And in her raiment's hem was traced in flame<br>
 <a name="fchr"></a>WISDOM, a name to shake<br>
 All evil dreams of power &shy; a sacred name.  <a href=
"#fch">5</a><br>
 And when she spake,<br>
<br>
 Her words did gather thunder as they ran,<br>
 And as the lightning to the thunder<br>
 Which follows it, riving the spirit of man,<br>
 Making earth wonder,<br>
<br>
 So was their meaning to her words.<br>
 <a name="fcir"></a>No sword<br>
 Of wrath her right arm whirl'd,  <a href="#fci">6</a><br>
 But one poor poet's scroll, and with <i>his</i> word<br>
 She shook the world.</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<a name="fcd"></a><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote
1:</span>  The expression, as is not uncommon with Tennyson, is
extremely ambiguous; it may mean that he hated hatred, scorned
scorn, and loved love, or that he had hatred, scorn and love as
it were in quintessence, like Dante, and that is no doubt the
meaning.<br>

<br>
First published in 1830.<br>
<br>
 A companion poem to the preceding. After line 7 in 1830 appears
this stanza, afterwards omitted: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Clear as summer mountain streams,<br>
 Bright as the inwoven beams,<br>
 Which beneath their crisping sapphire<br>
 In the midday, floating o'er<br>
 The golden sands, make evermore<br>
 To a blossom-starr&egrave;d shore.<br>
 Hence away, unhallowed laughter!</blockquote>

 Into every spicy flower<br>
 Of the laurel-shrubs that hedge it around.<br>
 The flowers would faint at your cruel cheer.<br>
 In your eye there is death,<br>
 There is frost in your breath<br>

 Where you stand you cannot hear<br>
 From the groves within<br>
 The wild-bird's din.<br>
 In the heart of the garden the merry bird chants,<br>
 It would fall to the ground if you came in.<br>
 In the middle leaps a fountain<br>
 Like sheet lightning,<br>
 Ever brightening<br>
 With a low melodious thunder;<br>
 All day and all night it is ever drawn<br>
 From the brain of the purple mountain<br>
 Which stands in the distance yonder:<br>
 It springs on a level of bowery lawn,<br>
 And the mountain draws it from Heaven above,<br>
 <a name="fckr"></a>And it sings a song of undying love;<br>
 And yet, tho'  <a href="#fck">2</a>  its voice be so clear and
full,<br>
 You never would hear it; your ears are so dull;<br>
 So keep where you are: you are foul with sin;<br>

<h3><a name="section26">The Sea Fairies</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1830 but excluded from all editions till its
restoration, when it was greatly altered, in 1853. I here give
the text as it appeared in 1830; where the present text is the
same as that of 1830 asterisks indicate it.<br>
<br>
This poem is a sort of prelude to the <i>Lotos-Eaters</i>, the
burthen being the same, a siren song: "Why work, why toil, when
all must be over so soon, and when at best there is so little to
reward?"<br>


<blockquote>Slow sailed the weary mariners, and saw<br>
 Between the green brink and the running foam<br>
 White limbs unrobed in a chrystal air,<br>
 Sweet faces, etc.<br>
 ...<br>
 middle sea.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Whither away, whither away, whither away?<br>
 Fly no more!<br>
 Whither away wi' the singing sail? whither away wi' the oar?<br>
 Whither away from the high green field and the happy blossoming
shore?<br>
 Weary mariners, hither away,<br>
 One and all, one and all,<br>
 Weary mariners, come and play;<br>
 We will sing to you all the day;<br>
 Furl the sail and the foam will fall<br>
 From the prow! one and all<br>
 Furl the sail! drop the oar!<br>
 Leap ashore!<br>
 Know danger and trouble and toil no more.<br>
 Whither away wi' the sail and the oar?<br>
 Drop the oar,<br>
 Leap ashore,<br>
 Fly no more!<br>
 Whither away wi' the sail? whither away wi' the oar?<br>
 Day and night to the billow, etc.<br>
 ...<br>
 over the lea;<br>
 They freshen the silvery-crimson shells,<br>
 And thick with white bells the cloverhill swells<br>
 High over the full-toned sea.<br>
 Merrily carol the revelling gales<br>
 Over the islands free:<br>
 From the green seabanks the rose downtrails<br>
 To the happy brimm&egrave;d sea.<br>
 Come hither, come hither, and be our lords,<br>
 For merry brides are we:<br>
 We will kiss sweet kisses, etc.<br>
 ...<br>
 With pleasure and love and revelry;<br>
 ...<br>
 ridg&egrave;d sea.<br>
 Ye will not find so happy a shore<br>
 Weary mariners! all the world o'er;<br>
 Oh! fly no more!<br>
 Harken ye, harken ye, sorrow shall darken ye,<br>
 Danger and trouble and toil no more;<br>
 Whither away?<br>
 Drop the oar;<br>
 Hither away,<br>
 Leap ashore;<br>
 Oh! fly no more &shy; no more.<br>
 Whither away, whither away, whither away with the sail and the
oar?<br>
<br>
 Slow sail'd the weary mariners and saw,<br>
 Betwixt the green brink and the running foam,<br>
 Sweet faces, rounded arms, and bosoms prest<br>
 To little harps of gold; and while they mused,<br>
 Whispering to each other half in fear,<br>
 Shrill music reach'd them on the middle sea.<br>
<br>
 Whither away, whither away, whither away? fly no more.<br>
 Whither away from the high green field, and the happy blossoming
shore?<br>
 Day and night to the billow the fountain calls;<br>
 Down shower the gambolling waterfalls<br>
 From wandering over the lea:<br>
 Out of the live-green heart of the dells<br>
 They freshen the silvery-crimsoned shells,<br>
 And thick with white bells the clover-hill swells<br>
 High over the full-toned sea:<br>
 O hither, come hither and furl your sails,<br>
 Come hither to me and to me:<br>
 Hither, come hither and frolic and play;<br>
 Here it is only the mew that wails;<br>
 We will sing to you all the day:<br>
 Mariner, mariner, furl your sails,<br>
 For here are the blissful downs and dales,<br>
 <a name="fclr"></a>And merrily merrily carol the gales,<br>
 And the spangle dances in bight  <a href="#fcl">1</a>  and
bay,<br>
 And the rainbow forms and flies on the land<br>
 Over the islands free;<br>
 And the rainbow lives in the curve of the sand;<br>
 Hither, come hither and see;<br>
 And the rainbow hangs on the poising wave,<br>
 And sweet is the colour of cove and cave,<br>
<br>
 And sweet shall your welcome be:<br>
 O hither, come hither, and be our lords<br>
 For merry brides are we:<br>
 We will kiss sweet kisses, and speak sweet words:<br>
 O listen, listen, your eyes shall glisten<br>
 With pleasure and love and jubilee:<br>
 O listen, listen, your eyes shall glisten<br>
 When the sharp clear twang of the golden cords<br>
 Runs up the ridged sea.<br>
 Who can light on as happy a shore<br>
 All the world o'er, all the world o'er?<br>
 Whither away? listen and stay: mariner, mariner, fly no
more.</blockquote>

mean a bend, and so a corner or bay. The same phrase occurs in

<h3><a name="section27">The Deserted House</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1830, omitted in all the editions till 1848 when

much in the vein of many poems in Anglo-Saxon poetry.<br>

<h3><a name="section28">The Dying Swan</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1830.<br>
<br>
The superstition here assumed is so familiar from the Classics as
well as from modern tradition that it scarcely needs illustration
or commentary. But see Plato, <i>Phaedrus</i>, xxxi., and
Shakespeare, <i>King John</i>, v., 7.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>1<br>
<br>
 The plain was grassy, wild and bare,<br>
 Wide, wild, and open to the air,<br>
 <a name="fcnr"></a>Which had built up everywhere<br>
 An under-roof of doleful gray.  <a href="#fcn">1</a><br>
 With an inner voice the river ran,<br>
 <a name="fcor"></a>Adown it floated a dying swan,<br>
 And  <a href="#fco">2</a>  loudly did lament.<br>
 It was the middle of the day.<br>
 Ever the weary wind went on,<br>
 And took the reed-tops as it went.<br>
<br>
<br>
 2<br>
<br>
 Some blue peaks in the distance rose,<br>
 And white against the cold-white sky,<br>
 <a name="fcpr"></a>Shone out their crowning snows.<br>
 One willow over the water  <a href="#fcp">3</a>  wept,<br>
 <a name="fcqr"></a>And shook the wave as the wind did sigh;<br>
 Above in the wind was  <a href="#fcq">4</a>  the swallow,<br>
 <a name="fcrr1"></a>Chasing itself at its own wild will,<br>
 And far thro'  <a href="#fcr1">5</a>  the marish green and
still<br>
 The tangled water-courses slept,<br>
 Shot over with purple, and green, and yellow.<br>
<br>
<br>
 3<br>
<br>
 The wild swan's death-hymn took the soul<br>
 Of that waste place with joy<br>
 Hidden in sorrow: at first to the ear<br>
 The warble was low, and full and clear;<br>
 <a name="fcsr"></a>And floating about the under-sky,<br>
 Prevailing in weakness, the coronach  <a href="#fcs">6</a>
 stole<br>
 Sometimes afar, and sometimes anear;<br>
 But anon her awful jubilant voice,<br>
 With a music strange and manifold,<br>
 Flow'd forth on a carol free and bold;<br>
 As when a mighty people rejoice<br>
 With shawms, and with cymbals, and harps of gold,<br>
 <a name="fctr"></a>And the tumult of their acclaim is roll'd<br>
 Thro'  <a href="#fct">7</a>  the open gates of the city
afar,<br>
 To the shepherd who watcheth the evening star.<br>
 And the creeping mosses and clambering weeds,<br>
 And the willow-branches hoar and dank,<br>
 And the wavy swell of the soughing reeds,<br>
 And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,<br>
 And the silvery marish-flowers that throng<br>
 The desolate creeks and pools among,<br>
 Were flooded over with eddying song.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section31">The Ballad of Oriana</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1830, not in 1833.<br>
<br>
This fine ballad was evidently suggested by the old ballad of
Helen of Kirkconnel, both poems being based on a similar
incident, and both being the passionate soliloquy of the bereaved
lover, though Tennyson's treatment of the subject is his own.
Helen of Kirkconnel was one of the poems which he was fond of
reciting, and Fitzgerald says that he used also to recite this
poem, in a way not to be forgotten, at Cambridge tables.
<i>Life</i>, i., p. 77.<br>


<blockquote>My heart is wasted with my woe, Oriana.<br>
 There is no rest for me below, Oriana.<br>
 When the long dun wolds are ribb'd with snow,<br>
 And loud the Norland whirlwinds blow, Oriana,<br>
 Alone I wander to and fro, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 Ere the light on dark was growing, Oriana,<br>
 At midnight the cock was crowing, Oriana:<br>
 Winds were blowing, waters flowing,<br>
 We heard the steeds to battle going, Oriana;<br>
 Aloud the hollow bugle blowing, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 In the yew-wood black as night, Oriana,<br>
 Ere I rode into the fight, Oriana,<br>
 While blissful tears blinded my sight<br>
 By star-shine and by moonlight, Oriana,<br>
 I to thee my troth did plight, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 She stood upon the castle wall, Oriana:<br>
 She watch'd my crest among them all, Oriana:<br>
 She saw me fight, she heard me call,<br>
 When forth there stept a foeman tall, Oriana,<br>
 Atween me and the castle wall, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 The bitter arrow went aside, Oriana:<br>
 The false, false arrow went aside, Oriana:<br>
 The damned arrow glanced aside,<br>
 And pierced thy heart, my love, my bride, Oriana!<br>
 Thy heart, my life, my love, my bride, Oriana!<br>
<br>
 Oh! narrow, narrow was the space, Oriana.<br>
 Loud, loud rung out the bugle's brays, Oriana.<br>
 Oh! deathful stabs were dealt apace,<br>
 The battle deepen'd in its place, Oriana;<br>
 But I was down upon my face, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 They should have stabb'd me where I lay, Oriana!<br>
 How could I rise and come away, Oriana?<br>
 How could I look upon the day?<br>
 They should have stabb'd me where I lay, Oriana<br>
 They should have trod me into clay, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 O breaking heart that will not break, Oriana!<br>
 O pale, pale face so sweet and meek, Oriana!<br>
 Thou smilest, but thou dost not speak,<br>
 And then the tears run down my cheek, Oriana:<br>
 What wantest thou? whom dost thou seek, Oriana?<br>
<br>
 I cry aloud: none hear my cries, Oriana.<br>
 Thou comest atween me and the skies, Oriana.<br>
 I feel the tears of blood arise<br>
 Up from my heart unto my eyes, Oriana.<br>
 Within my heart my arrow lies, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 O cursed hand! O cursed blow! Oriana!<br>
 O happy thou that liest low, Oriana!<br>
 All night the silence seems to flow<br>
 Beside me in my utter woe, Oriana.<br>
 A weary, weary way I go, Oriana.<br>
<br>
 When Norland winds pipe down the sea, Oriana,<br>
 I walk, I dare not think of thee, Oriana.<br>
 Thou liest beneath the greenwood tree,<br>
 I dare not die and come to thee, Oriana.<br>
 I hear the roaring of the sea, Oriana.</blockquote>

 Sitting alone,<br>
 Singing alone<br>
 Under the sea,<br>
 With a crown of gold,<br>
 On a throne?<br>

 2<br>
<br>
 I would be a merman bold;<br>
 I would sit and sing the whole of the day;<br>
 I would fill the sea-halls with a voice of power;<br>
 But at night I would roam abroad and play<br>
 With the mermaids in and out of the rocks,<br>
 Dressing their hair with the white sea-flower;<br>
 And holding them back by their flowing locks<br>
 I would kiss them often under the sea,<br>
 And kiss them again till they kiss'd me<br>
 Laughingly, laughingly;<br>
 And then we would wander away, away<br>
 To the pale-green sea-groves straight and high,<br>
 Chasing each other merrily.<br>

<br>
 There would be neither moon nor star;<br>

 Low thunder and light in the magic night &shy;<br>

 We would call aloud in the dreamy dells,<br>
 Call to each other and whoop and cry<br>
 All night, merrily, merrily;<br>
 They would pelt me with starry spangles and shells,<br>
 Laughing and clapping their hands between,<br>
 All night, merrily, merrily:<br>

 Turkis and agate and almondine:  <a href="#fde">1</a><br>

 Under the hollow-hung ocean green!<br>
 Soft are the moss-beds under the sea;<br>

<br>
 Who would be<br>

 Singing alone,<br>
 Combing her hair<br>
 Under the sea,<br>
 In a golden curl<br>
 With a comb of pearl,<br>

 2<br>

 I would be a mermaid fair;<br>
 I would sing to myself the whole of the day;<br>
 With a comb of pearl I would comb my hair;<br>
 And still as I comb'd I would sing and say,<br>
 "Who is it loves me? who loves not me?"<br>
 I would comb my hair till my ringlets would fall,<br>
 Low adown, low adown,<br>
 From under my starry sea-bud crown<br>
 Low adown and around,<br>
 And I should look like a fountain of gold<br>
 Springing alone<br>
 With a shrill inner sound,<br>
 Over the throne<br>
 <a name="fdfr"></a>In the midst of the hall;<br>
 Till that  <a href="#fdf">1</a>  great sea-snake under the
sea<br>
 From his coiled sleeps in the central deeps<br>
 Would slowly trail himself sevenfold<br>
 Round the hall where I sate, and look in at the gate<br>
 With his large calm eyes for the love of me.<br>
 <a name="fdgr"></a>And all the mermen under the sea<br>
 Would feel their  <a href="#fdg">2</a>  immortality<br>
 Die in their hearts for the love of me.<br>

3<br>
<br>
 But at night I would wander away, away,<br>
 I would fling on each side my low-flowing locks,<br>

 With the mermen in and out of the rocks;<br>
 <a name="fdhr"></a>We would run to and fro, and hide and
seek,<br>
 On the broad sea-wolds in the  <a href="#fdh">3</a>  crimson
shells,<br>
 Whose silvery spikes are nighest the sea.<br>
 But if any came near I would call, and shriek,<br>
 And adown the steep like a wave I would leap<br>
 <a name="fdir"></a>From the diamond-ledges that jut from the
dells;<br>
 For I would not be kiss'd  <a href="#fdi">4</a>  by all who
would list,<br>
 Of the bold merry mermen under the sea;<br>
 They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me,<br>
 In the purple twilights under the sea;<br>
 But the king of them all would carry me,<br>
 Woo me, and win me, and marry me,<br>
 In the branching jaspers under the sea;<br>
 Then all the dry pied things that be<br>
 In the hueless mosses under the sea<br>
 Would curl round my silver feet silently,<br>
 All looking up for the love of me.<br>
 And if I should carol aloud, from aloft<br>
 All things that are forked, and horned, and soft<br>
 Would lean out from the hollow sphere of the sea,<br>
 All looking down for the love of me.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section35">Sonnet to J. M. K.</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1830, not in 1833.<br>
<br>
This sonnet was addressed to John Mitchell Kemble, the well-known
Editor of the <i>Beowulf</i> and other Anglo-Saxon poems. He
intended to go into the Church, but was never ordained, and
devoted his life to early English studies. See memoir of him in
<i>Dict, of Nat. Biography</i>.<br>


<blockquote>My hope and heart is with thee &shy; thou wilt be<br>
 A latter Luther, and a soldier-priest<br>
 To scare church-harpies from the master's feast;<br>
 Our dusted velvets have much need of thee:<br>
 Thou art no Sabbath-drawler of old saws,<br>
 Distill'd from some worm-canker'd homily;<br>
 But spurr'd at heart with fieriest energy<br>
 To embattail and to wall about thy cause<br>
 With iron-worded proof, hating to hark<br>
 The humming of the drowsy pulpit-drone<br>
 Half God's good sabbath, while the worn-out clerk<br>
 Brow-beats his desk below. Thou from a throne<br>
 Mounted in heaven wilt shoot into the dark<br>
 Arrows of lightnings. I will stand and mark.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section36">The Lady of Shalott</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833.<br>
<br>
This poem was composed in its first form as early as May, 1832 or
1833, as we learn from Fitzgerald's note &shy; of the exact year
he was not certain (<i>Life of Tennyson</i>, i., 147). The
evolution of the poem is an interesting study. How greatly it was
altered in the second edition of 1842 will be evident from the
collation which follows. The text of 1842 became the permanent
text, and in this no subsequent material alterations were made.
The poem is more purely fanciful than Tennyson perhaps was
willing to own; certainly his explanation of the allegory, as he
gave it to Canon Ainger, is not very intelligible: "The new-born
love for something, for some one in the wide world from which she
has been so long excluded, takes her out of the region of shadows
into that of realities". Poe's commentary is most to the point:
"Why do some persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel
such phantasy pieces as the <i>Lady of Shallot</i>? As well
unweave the ventum textilem". &shy; <i>Democratic Review</i>,
Dec., 1844, quoted by Mr. Herne Shepherd. Mr. Palgrave says
(selection from the <i>Lyric Poems of Tennyson</i>, p. 257) the
poem was suggested by an Italian romance upon the Donna di
Scalotta. On what authority this is said I do not know, nor can I
identify the novel. In Novella, lxxxi., a collection of novels
printed at Milan in 1804, there is one which tells but very
briefly the story of Elaine's love and death, "Qui conta come la
Damigella di scalot mori per amore di Lancealotto di Lac," and as
in this novel Camelot is placed near the sea, this may be the
novel referred to. In any case the poem is a fanciful and
possibly an allegorical variant of the story of Elaine, Shalott
being a form, through the French, of Astolat.<br>
<br>


<blockquote><b>Part I</b><br>
<br>
 On either side the river lie<br>
 Long fields of barley and of rye,<br>
 That clothe the wold and meet the sky;<br>
 And thro' the field the road runs by<br>
 To many-tower'd Camelot;<br>
 And up and down the people go,<br>
 <a name="fdjr"></a>Gazing where the lilies blow<br>
 <a name="fdkr"></a>Round an island there below,<br>
 The island of Shalott.  <a href="#fdj">1</a><br>
<br>
 Willows whiten, aspens quiver,  <a href="#fdk">2</a><br>
 Little breezes dusk and shiver<br>
 Thro' the wave that runs for ever<br>
 By the island in the river<br>
 Flowing down to Camelot.<br>
 Four gray walls, and four gray towers,<br>
 Overlook a space of flowers,<br>
 And the silent isle imbowers<br>
 The Lady of Shalott.<br>
<br>
 By the margin, willow-veil'd<br>
 Slide the heavy barges trail'd<br>
 By slow horses; and unhail'd<br>
 The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd<br>
 Skimming down to Camelot:<br>
 But who hath seen her wave her hand?<br>
 Or at the casement seen her stand?<br>
 <a name="fdlr"></a>Or is she known in all the land,<br>
 The Lady of Shalott?  <a href="#fdl">3</a><br>
<br>
 Only reapers, reaping early<br>
 In among the bearded barley,<br>
 Hear a song that echoes cheerly<br>
 From the river winding clearly,<br>
 Down to tower'd Camelot:<br>
 And by the moon the reaper weary,<br>
 Piling sheaves in uplands airy,<br>
 <a name="fdmr"></a>Listening, whispers "'Tis the fairy<br>
 Lady of Shalott".  <a href="#fdm">4</a><br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>Part II</b><br>
<br>
 There she weaves by night and day<br>
 A magic web with colours gay.<br>
 <a name="fdnr"></a>She has heard a whisper say,<br>
 A curse is on her if she stay  <a href="#fdn">5</a><br>
 To look down to Camelot.<br>
 <a name="fdor"></a>She knows not what the <i>curse</i> may
be,<br>
 And so  <a href="#fdo">6</a>  she weaveth steadily,<br>
 And little other care hath she,<br>
 The Lady of Shalott.<br>
<br>
 And moving thro' a mirror clear<br>
 That hangs before her all the year,<br>
 Shadows of the world appear.<br>
 There she sees the highway near<br>
 Winding down to Camelot:<br>
 <a name="fdpr"></a>There the river eddy whirls,<br>
 And there the surly village-churls,  <a href="#fdp">7</a><br>
 And the red cloaks of market girls,<br>
 Pass onward from Shalott.<br>
<br>
 Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,<br>
 An abbot on an ambling pad,<br>
 Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,<br>
 Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,<br>
 Goes by to tower'd Camelot;<br>
 And sometimes thro' the mirror blue<br>
 The knights come riding two and two:<br>
 She hath no loyal knight and true,<br>
 The Lady of Shalott.<br>
<br>
 But in her web she still delights<br>
 To weave the mirror's magic sights,<br>
 For often thro' the silent nights<br>
 <a name="fdqr"></a>A funeral, with plumes and lights,<br>
 And music, went to Camelot:  <a href="#fdq">8</a><br>
 Or when the moon was overhead,<br>
 Came two young lovers lately wed;<br>
 <a name="fdrr1"></a>"I am half-sick of shadows," said<br>
 The Lady of Shalott.  <a href="#fdr1">9</a><br>

 A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,<br>
 He rode between the barley sheaves,<br>
 The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,<br>
 And flamed upon the brazen greaves<br>
 Of bold Sir Lancelot.<br>
 A redcross knight for ever kneel'd<br>
 To a lady in his shield,<br>
 That sparkled on the yellow field,<br>
 Beside remote Shalott.<br>
<br>
 The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,<br>

 Hung in the golden Galaxy.  <a href="#fds">10</a><br>

 And as he rode his armour rung,<br>
 Beside remote Shalott.<br>
<br>
 All in the blue unclouded weather<br>
 Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,<br>
 The helmet and the helmet-feather<br>
 <a name="fdur"></a>Burn'd like one burning flame together,<br>
 As he rode down to Camelot.  <a href="#fdu">12</a><br>

 As he rode down to Camelot.  <a href="#fdw">14</a><br>
 From the bank and from the river<br>

 "Tirra lirra," by the river  <a href="#fdx">15</a><br>
 Sang Sir Lancelot.<br>

 Out flew the web and floated wide;<br>
 The mirror crack'd from side to side;<br>

 The Lady of Shalott.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>Part IV</b><br>
<br>
 In the stormy east-wind straining,<br>
 The pale yellow woods were waning,<br>
 The broad stream in his banks complaining,<br>
 Heavily the low sky raining<br>
 Over tower'd Camelot;<br>
 Down she came and found a boat<br>
 Beneath a willow left afloat,<br>
 <a name="fdzr"></a>And round about the prow she wrote<br>
 <i>The Lady of Shalott</i>. <a href="#fdz">17</a><br>
<br>
 And down the river's dim expanse &shy;<br>
 Like some bold se&euml;r in a trance,<br>
 Seeing all his own mischance &shy;<br>
 With a glassy countenance<br>
 Did she look to Camelot.<br>
 And at the closing of the day<br>
 She loosed the chain, and down she lay;<br>
 The broad stream bore her far away,<br>
 The Lady of Shalott.<br>
<br>
 Lying, robed in snowy white<br>
 That loosely flew to left and right &shy;<br>
 The leaves upon her falling light &shy;<br>
 Thro' the noises of the night<br>
 She floated down to Camelot;<br>
 And as the boat-head wound along<br>
 The willowy hills and fields among,<br>

<h3><a name="section37">Mariana in the South</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1833.<br>
<br>
This poem had been written as early as 1831 (see Arthur Hallam's
letter, <i>Life</i>, i., 284-5, Appendix), and Lord Tennyson
tells us that it "came to my father as he was travelling between
Narbonne and Perpignan"; how vividly the characteristic features
of Southern France are depicted must be obvious to every one who
is familiar with them. It is interesting to compare it with the
companion poem; the central position is the same in both,
desolate loneliness, and the mood is the same, but the setting is
far more picturesque and is therefore more dwelt upon. The poem
was very greatly altered when re-published in 1842, that text
being practically the final one, there being no important
variants afterwards.<br>
<br>
In the edition of 1833 the poem opened with the following stanza,
which was afterwards excised and the stanza of the present text
substituted.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>Behind the barren hill upsprung<br>
 With pointed rocks against the light,<br>
 The crag sharpshadowed overhung<br>
 Each glaring creek and inlet bright.<br>
 Far, far, one light blue ridge was seen,<br>
 Looming like baseless fairyland;<br>
 Eastward a slip of burning sand,<br>
 Dark-rimmed with sea, and bare of green,<br>
 Down in the dry salt-marshes stood<br>
 That house dark latticed. Not a breath<br>
 Swayed the sick vineyard underneath,<br>
 Or moved the dusty southernwood.<br>
 "Madonna," with melodious moan<br>
 Sang Mariana, night and morn,<br>
 "Madonna! lo! I am all alone,<br>
 Love-forgotten and love-forlorn."<br>
<br>
 With one black shadow at its feet,<br>
 The house thro' all the level shines,<br>
 Close-latticed to the brooding heat,<br>
 And silent in its dusty vines:<br>
 A faint-blue ridge upon the right,<br>
 An empty river-bed before,<br>
 And shallows on a distant shore,<br>
 In glaring sand and inlets bright.<br>
 But "Ave Mary," made she moan,<br>
 And "Ave Mary," night and morn,<br>
 And "Ah," she sang, "to be all alone,<br>
 To live forgotten, and love forlorn".<br>
<br>
 <a name="fegr"></a>She, as her carol sadder grew,<br>
 From brow and bosom slowly down  <a href="#feg">1</a><br>
 Thro' rosy taper fingers drew<br>
 <a name="fehr"></a>Her streaming curls of deepest brown<br>
 To left and right,  <a href="#feh">2</a>  and made appear,<br>
 <a name="feir"></a>Still-lighted in a secret shrine,<br>
 Her melancholy eyes divine,  <a href="#fei">3</a><br>
 <a name="fejr"></a>The home of woe without a tear.<br>
 And "Ave Mary," was her moan,  <a href="#fej">4</a><br>
 "Madonna, sad is night and morn";<br>
 And "Ah," she sang, "to be all alone,<br>
 <a name="fekr"></a>To live forgotten, and love forlorn".<br>
<br>
 Till all the crimson changed,  <a href="#fek">5</a>  and
past<br>
 Into deep orange o'er the sea,<br>
 Low on her knees herself she cast,<br>
 Before Our Lady murmur'd she;<br>
 Complaining, "Mother, give me grace<br>
 To help me of my weary load".<br>
 And on the liquid mirror glow'd<br>
 The clear perfection of her face.<br>
 "Is this the form," she made her moan,<br>
 "That won his praises night and morn?"<br>
 <a name="felr"></a>And "Ah," she said, "but I wake alone,<br>
 I sleep forgotten, I wake forlorn".  <a href="#fel">6</a><br>
<br>
 Nor bird would sing, nor lamb would bleat,<br>
 Nor any cloud would cross the vault,<br>
 But day increased from heat to heat,<br>
 On stony drought and steaming salt;<br>
 Till now at noon she slept again,<br>
 And seem'd knee-deep in mountain grass,<br>
 And heard her native breezes pass,<br>
 And runlets babbling down the glen.<br>
 She breathed in sleep a lower moan,<br>
 And murmuring, as at night and morn,<br>
 <a name="femr"></a>She thought, "My spirit is here alone,<br>
 Walks forgotten, and is forlorn".  <a href="#fem">7</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="fenr"></a>Dreaming, she knew it was a dream:<br>
 She felt he was and was not there,  <a href="#fen">8</a><br>
 She woke: the babble of the stream<br>
 <a name="feor"></a>Fell, and without the steady glare<br>
 Shrank one sick willow  <a href="#feo">9</a>  sere and
small.<br>
 The river-bed was dusty-white;<br>
 <a name="fepr"></a>And all the furnace of the light<br>
 Struck up against the blinding wall.  <a href="#fep">10</a><br>
 She whisper'd, with a stifled moan<br>
 More inward than at night or morn,<br>
 <a name="feqr"></a>"Sweet Mother, let me not here alone<br>
 Live forgotten, and die forlorn".  <a href="#feq">11</a><br>
<br>
 <a href="#fer1">12</a>  And rising, from her bosom drew<br>
 <a name="ferr1"></a>Old letters, breathing of her worth,<br>
 For "Love," they said, "must needs be true,<br>
 To what is loveliest upon earth".<br>
 An image seem'd to pass the door,<br>
 To look at her with slight, and say,<br>
 "But now thy beauty flows away,<br>
 So be alone for evermore".<br>
 "O cruel heart," she changed her tone,<br>
 "And cruel love, whose end is scorn,<br>
 Is this the end to be left alone,<br>
 To live forgotten, and die forlorn!"<br>
<br>
 But sometimes in the falling day<br>
 An image seem'd to pass the door,<br>
 To look into her eyes and say,<br>
 "But thou shalt be alone no more".<br>
 And flaming downward over all<br>
 From heat to heat the day decreased,<br>
 And slowly rounded to the east<br>
 The one black shadow from the wall.<br>
 "The day to night," she made her moan,<br>
 "The day to night, the night to morn,<br>
 And day and night I am left alone<br>
 To live forgotten, and love forlorn."<br>
<br>
 At eve a dry cicala sung,<br>
 There came a sound as of the sea;<br>
 Backward the lattice-blind she flung,<br>
 And lean'd upon the balcony.<br>
 There all in spaces rosy-bright<br>
 Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,<br>
 And deepening thro' the silent spheres,<br>
 Heaven over Heaven rose the night.<br>
 And weeping then she made her moan,<br>
 "The night comes on that knows not morn,<br>
 <a name="fesr"></a>When I shall cease to be all alone,<br>
 To live forgotten, and love forlorn".  <a href=

 Thought seems to come and go<br>
 In thy large eyes, imperial Ele&auml;nore.<br>

 <a name="ffbr"></a>As thunder-clouds that, hung on high,<br>
 Roof'd the world with doubt and fear,  <a href="#ffb">9</a><br>
 Floating thro' an evening atmosphere,<br>
 Grow golden all about the sky;<br>
 In thee all passion becomes passionless,<br>
 Touch'd by thy spirit's mellowness,<br>
 Losing his fire and active might<br>
 In a silent meditation,<br>
 Falling into a still delight,<br>
 And luxury of contemplation:<br>
 As waves that up a quiet cove<br>
 <a name="ffcr"></a>Rolling slide, and lying still<br>
 Shadow forth the banks at will:  <a href="#ffc">10</a><br>
 Or sometimes they swell and move,<br>
 Pressing up against the land,<br>
 With motions of the outer sea:<br>
 And the self-same influence<br>
 Controlleth all the soul and sense<br>
 Of Passion gazing upon thee.<br>
 <a name="ffdr"></a>His bow-string slacken'd, languid Love,<br>
 Leaning his cheek upon his hand,  <a href="#ffd">11</a><br>
 Droops both his wings, regarding thee,<br>
 And so would languish evermore,<br>
 Serene, imperial Ele&auml;nore.<br>
<br>
<br>
8<br>
<br>
 But when I see thee roam, with tresses unconfined,<br>
 While the amorous, odorous wind<br>
 Breathes low between the sunset and the moon;<br>
 Or, in a shadowy saloon,<br>
 On silken cushions half reclined;<br>
 <a name="ffer"></a>I watch thy grace; and in its place<br>
 My heart a charmed slumber keeps,  <a href="#ffe">12</a><br>
 While I muse upon thy face;<br>
 And a languid fire creeps<br>
 Thro' my veins to all my frame,<br>
 Dissolvingly and slowly: soon<br>

 Floweth; and then, as in a swoon,  <a href="#fff">13</a><br>

<h3><a name="section39">The Miller's Daughter</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833. It was greatly altered when republished
in 1842, and in some respects, so Fitzgerald thought, not for the
better. No alterations of much importance were made in it after
1842. The characters as well as the scenery were, it seems,
purely imaginary. Tennyson said that if he thought of any mill it
was that of Trumpington, near Cambridge, which bears a general
resemblance to the picture here given.<br>
<br>
In the first edition the poem opened with the following stanza,
which the <i>Quarterly</i> ridiculed, and which was afterwards
excised. Its omission is surely not to be regretted, whatever
Fitzgerald may have thought.<br>


<blockquote>I met in all the close green ways,<br>
 While walking with my line and rod,<br>
 The wealthy miller's mealy face,<br>
 Like the moon in an ivy-tod.<br>
 He looked so jolly and so good &shy;<br>
 While fishing in the milldam-water,<br>
 I laughed to see him as he stood,<br>
 And dreamt not of the miller's daughter.</blockquote>

<hr width="50%" align="left">
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I see the wealthy miller yet,<br>
 His double chin, his portly size,<br>
 And who that knew him could forget<br>
 The busy wrinkles round his eyes?<br>
 The slow wise smile that, round about<br>
 His dusty forehead drily curl'd,<br>
 Seem'd half-within and half-without,<br>
 And full of dealings with the world?<br>
<br>
 In yonder chair I see him sit,<br>
 Three fingers round the old silver cup &shy;<br>
 I see his gray eyes twinkle yet<br>
 At his own jest &shy; gray eyes lit up<br>
 With summer lightnings of a soul<br>
 <a name="ffhr"></a> So full of summer warmth, so glad,<br>
 <a name="ffir"></a>So healthy, sound, and clear and whole,<br>
 His memory scarce can make me  <a href="#ffh">1</a>  sad.<br>
<br>
 <a name="ffjr"></a>Yet fill my glass: give me one kiss:<br>
 My own sweet  <a href="#ffi">2</a>  Alice, we must die.<br>
 There's somewhat in this world amiss<br>
 Shall be unriddled by and by.<br>
 There's somewhat flows to us in life,<br>
 But more is taken quite away.<br>
 Pray, Alice, pray, my darling wife,  <a href="#ffj">3</a><br>
 That we may die the self-same day.<br>
<br>
 Have I not found a happy earth?<br>
 I least should breathe a thought of pain.<br>
 Would God renew me from my birth<br>
 I'd almost live my life again.<br>
 So sweet it seems with thee to walk,<br>
 And once again to woo thee mine &shy;<br>
 <a name="ffkr"></a>It seems in after-dinner talk<br>
 Across the walnuts and the wine &shy;  <a href="#ffk">4</a><br>
<br>
 To be the long and listless boy<br>
 <a name="fflr"></a>Late-left an orphan of the squire,<br>
 <a name="ffmr"></a>Where this old mansion mounted high<br>
 Looks down upon the village spire:  <a href="#ffl">5</a><br>
 For even here,  <a href="#ffm">6</a>  where I and you<br>
 Have lived and loved alone so long,<br>
 Each morn my sleep was broken thro'<br>
 By some wild skylark's matin song.<br>
<br>
 <a name="ffnr"></a>And oft I heard the tender dove<br>
 In firry woodlands making moan;  <a href="#ffn">7</a><br>
 But ere I saw your eyes, my love,<br>
 I had no motion of my own.<br>
 For scarce my life with fancy play'd<br>
 Before I dream'd that pleasant dream &shy;<br>
 <a name="ffor"></a>Still hither thither idly sway'd<br>
 Like those long mosses  <a href="#ffo">8</a>  in the stream.<br>
<br>
 Or from the bridge I lean'd to hear<br>
 The milldam rushing down with noise,<br>
 And see the minnows everywhere<br>
 <a name="ffpr"></a>In crystal eddies glance and poise,<br>
 The tall flag-flowers when  <a href="#ffp">9</a>  they
sprung<br>
 Below the range of stepping-stones,<br>
 <a name="ffqr"></a>Or those three chestnuts near, that hung<br>
 In masses thick with milky cones.  <a href="#ffq">10</a><br>
<br>
 But, Alice, what an hour was that,<br>
 When after roving in the woods<br>
 ('Twas April then), I came and sat<br>
 Below the chestnuts, when their buds<br>
 Were glistening to the breezy blue;<br>
 And on the slope, an absent fool,<br>
 <a name="ffrr1"></a>I cast me down, nor thought of you,<br>
 But angled in the higher pool.  <a href="#ffr1">11</a><br>
<br>
 A love-song I had somewhere read,<br>
 An echo from a measured strain,<br>
 Beat time to nothing in my head<br>
 From some odd corner of the brain.<br>
 It haunted me, the morning long,<br>
 With weary sameness in the rhymes,<br>
 The phantom of a silent song,<br>
 That went and came a thousand times.<br>
<br>
 Then leapt a trout. In lazy mood<br>
 I watch'd the little circles die;<br>
 They past into the level flood,<br>
 And there a vision caught my eye;<br>
 The reflex of a beauteous form,<br>
 A glowing arm, a gleaming neck,<br>
 <a name="ffsr"></a>As when a sunbeam wavers warm<br>
 Within the dark and dimpled beck.  <a href="#ffs">12</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="fftr"></a>For you remember, you had set,<br>
 That morning, on the casement's edge  <a href="#fft">13</a><br>
 A long green box of mignonette,<br>
 And you were leaning from the ledge:<br>
 And when I raised my eyes, above<br>
 They met with two so full and bright &shy;<br>
 <a name="ffur"></a>Such eyes! I swear to you, my love,<br>
 That these have never lost their light.  <a href=
"#ffu">14</a><br>
<br>
 I loved, and love dispell'd the fear<br>
 That I should die an early death:<br>
 For love possess'd the atmosphere,<br>
 And filled the breast with purer breath.<br>
 My mother thought, What ails the boy?<br>
 For I was alter'd, and began<br>
 To move about the house with joy,<br>
 And with the certain step of man.<br>
<br>
 I loved the brimming wave that swam<br>
 Thro' quiet meadows round the mill,<br>
 The sleepy pool above the dam,<br>
 The pool beneath it never still,<br>
 The meal-sacks on the whiten'd floor,<br>
 The dark round of the dripping wheel,<br>
 The very air about the door<br>
 Made misty with the floating meal.<br>
<br>
 And oft in ramblings on the wold,<br>
 When April nights begin to blow,<br>
 And April's crescent glimmer'd cold,<br>
 I saw the village lights below;<br>
 I knew your taper far away,<br>
 And full at heart of trembling hope,<br>
 <a name="ffvr"></a>From off the wold I came, and lay<br>
 Upon the freshly-flower'd slope.  <a href="#ffv">15</a><br>
<br>
 The deep brook groan'd beneath the mill;<br>
 <a name="ffwr"></a>And "by that lamp," I thought "she sits!"<br>
 The white chalk-quarry  <a href="#ffw">16</a>  from the hill<br>
 Gleam'd to the flying moon by fits.<br>
 "O that I were beside her now!<br>
 O will she answer if I call?<br>
 <a name="ffxr"></a>O would she give me vow for vow,<br>
 Sweet Alice, if I told her all?"  <a href="#ffx">17</a><br>
<br>
 Sometimes I saw you sit and spin;<br>
 And, in the pauses of the wind,<br>
 Sometimes I heard you sing within;<br>
 Sometimes your shadow cross'd the blind.<br>
 At last you rose and moved the light,<br>
 And the long shadow of the chair<br>
 Flitted across into the night,<br>
 And all the casement darken'd there.<br>
<br>
 But when at last I dared to speak,<br>
 <a name="ffyr"></a>The lanes, you know, were white with may,<br>
 <a name="ffzr"></a>Your ripe lips moved not, but your cheek<br>
 Flush'd like the coming of the day;  <a href="#ffy">18</a><br>
 And so it was &shy; half-sly, half-shy,  <a href=
"#ffz">19</a><br>
 You would, and would not, little one!<br>
 Although I pleaded tenderly,<br>
 And you and I were all alone.<br>
<br>
 And slowly was my mother brought<br>
 To yield consent to my desire:<br>
 She wish'd me happy, but she thought<br>
 I might have look'd a little higher;<br>
 And I was young &shy; too young to wed:<br>
 "Yet must I love her for your sake;<br>
 Go fetch your Alice here," she said:<br>
 Her eyelid quiver'd as she spake.<br>
<br>
 And down I went to fetch my bride:<br>
 But, Alice, you were ill at ease;<br>
 This dress and that by turns you tried,<br>
 Too fearful that you should not please.<br>
 I loved you better for your fears,<br>
 I knew you could not look but well;<br>
 <a name="fgar"></a>And dews, that would have fall'n in
tears,<br>
 I kiss'd away before they fell.  <a href="#fga">20</a><br>
<br>
 I watch'd the little flutterings,<br>
 The doubt my mother would not see;<br>
 She spoke at large of many things,<br>
 And at the last she spoke of me;<br>
 And turning look'd upon your face,<br>
 As near this door you sat apart,<br>
 <a name="fgbr"></a>And rose, and, with a silent grace<br>
 Approaching, press'd you heart to heart.  <a href=
"#fgb">21</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="fgcr"></a>Ah, well &shy; but sing the foolish song<br>
 I gave you, Alice, on the day  <a href="#fgc">22</a><br>
 When, arm in arm, we went along,<br>
 A pensive pair, and you were gay,<br>
 With bridal flowers &shy; that I may seem,<br>
 As in the nights of old, to lie<br>
 <a name="fgdr"></a>Beside the mill-wheel in the stream,<br>
 While those full chestnuts whisper by.  <a href=
"#fgd">23</a><br>
<br>
 It is the miller's daughter,<br>
 And she is grown so dear, so dear,<br>
 <a name="fger"></a>That I would be the jewel<br>
 That trembles at  <a href="#fge">24</a>  her ear:<br>
 For hid in ringlets day and night,<br>
 I'd touch her neck so warm and white.<br>
<br>
 And I would be the girdle<br>
 About her dainty, dainty waist,<br>
 And her heart would beat against me,<br>
 In sorrow and in rest:<br>
 <a name="fgfr"></a>And I should know if it beat right,<br>
 I'd clasp it round so close and tight.  <a href=
"#fgf">25</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="fggr"></a>And I would be the necklace,<br>
 And all day long to fall and rise  <a href="#fgg">26</a><br>
 <a name="fghr"></a>Upon her balmy bosom,<br>
 <a name="fgir"></a>With her laughter or her sighs,<br>
 And I would lie so light, so light,  <a href="#fgh">27</a><br>
 I scarce should be  <a href="#fgi">28</a>  unclasp'd at
night.<br>
<br>
 A trifle, sweet! which true love spells<br>
 True love interprets &shy; right alone.<br>
 <a name="fgjr"></a>His light upon the letter dwells,<br>
 For all the spirit is his own.  <a href="#fgj">29</a><br>
 So, if I waste words now, in truth<br>
 You must blame Love. His early rage<br>
 <a name="fgkr"></a>Had force to make me rhyme in youth<br>
 And makes me talk too much in age.  <a href="#fgk">30</a><br>
<br>
 And now those vivid hours are gone,<br>
 Like mine own life to me thou art,<br>
 Where Past and Present, wound in one,<br>
 <a name="fglr"></a>Do make a garland for the heart:<br>
 So sing  <a href="#fgl">31</a>  that other song I made,<br>
 <a name="fgmr"></a>Half anger'd with my happy lot,<br>
 <a name="fgnr"></a>The day, when in the chestnut shade<br>
 I found the blue Forget-me-not.  <a href="#fgm">32</a><br>
<br>
 Love that hath us in the net,  <a href="#fgn">33</a><br>
 Can he pass, and we forget?<br>
 Many suns arise and set.<br>
 Many a chance the years beget.<br>
 Love the gift is Love the debt.<br>
 Even so.<br>
 Love is hurt with jar and fret.<br>
 Love is made a vague regret.<br>
 Eyes with idle tears are wet.<br>
 Idle habit links us yet.<br>
 <a name="fgor"></a>What is love? for we forget:<br>
 Ah, no! no!  <a href="#fgo">34</a><br>
<br>
 Look thro' mine eyes with thine. True wife,<br>
 Round my true heart thine arms entwine;<br>
 My other dearer life in life,<br>
 Look thro' my very soul with thine!<br>
 Untouch'd with any shade of years,<br>
 May those kind eyes for ever dwell!<br>
 They have not shed a many tears,<br>
 Dear eyes, since first I knew them well.<br>
<br>
 Yet tears they shed: they had their part<br>
 Of sorrow: for when time was ripe,<br>
 The still affection of the heart<br>
 Became an outward breathing type,<br>
 That into stillness past again,<br>
 And left a want unknown before;<br>
 Although the loss that brought us pain,<br>
 That loss but made us love the more.<br>
<br>
 With farther lookings on. The kiss,<br>
 The woven arms, seem but to be<br>
 Weak symbols of the settled bliss,<br>
 The comfort, I have found in thee:<br>
 But that God bless thee, dear &shy; who wrought<br>
 Two spirits to one equal mind &shy;<br>
 With blessings beyond hope or thought,<br>
 With blessings which no words can find.<br>
<br>
 Arise, and let us wander forth,<br>
 <a name="fgpr"></a>To yon old mill across the wolds;<br>
 For look, the sunset, south and north,  <a href=
"#fgp">35</a><br>
 Winds all the vale in rosy folds,<br>
 And fires your narrow casement glass,<br>
 Touching the sullen pool below:<br>
 On the chalk-hill the bearded grass<br>
 Is dry and dewless. Let us go.</blockquote>

 I stepped upon the old mill-bridge.<br>
 I heard you whisper from above<br>
 A lute-toned whisper, "I am here";<br>
 I murmured, "Speak again, my love,<br>
 The stream is loud: I cannot hear ".<br>
<br>
 I heard, as I have seemed to hear,<br>
 When all the under-air was still,<br>
 The low voice of the glad new year<br>
 Call to the freshly-flowered hill.<br>
 I heard, as I have often heard<br>
 The nightingale in leavy woods<br>
 Call to its mate, when nothing stirred<br>
 To left or right but falling floods.</blockquote>

This stanza bears so close a resemblance to a stanza in Joshua
Sylvester's <i>Woodman's Bear</i> (see Sylvester's <i>Works</i>,

Sylvester had suggested it. Tennyson replied that he had never
seen Sylvester's lines (<i>Life of Tennyson</i>, iii., 51). The
lines are: &shy;

<h3><a name="section40">Fatima</a></h3>

<br>
First printed in 1833.<br>
<br>
The 1833 edition has no title but this quotation from Sappho
prefixed: &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="TG21.gif" width="206" height="32" alt=
"Greek (transliterated): Phainetai moi kaenos isos theoisin Emmen anaer' &shy; SAPPHO.">
</blockquote>

<br>
 The title was prefixed in 1842; it is a name taken from <i>The
Arabian Nights</i> or from the Moall&acirc;kat. The poem was
evidently inspired by Sappho's great ode. <i>Cf.</i> also
Fragment I. of Ibycus. In the intensity of the passion it stands
alone among Tennyson's poems.<br>

 Throbbing thro' all thy heat and light,<br>
 Lo, falling from my constant mind,<br>
 Lo, parch'd and wither'd, deaf and blind,<br>
 I whirl like leaves in roaring wind.<br>

 <a name="fgtr"></a>With one long kiss, my whole soul thro'<br>
 My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew.  <a href="#fgt">4</a><br>
<br>
 Before he mounts the hill, I know<br>
 He cometh quickly: from below<br>
 Sweet gales, as from deep gardens, blow<br>
 Before him, striking on my brow.<br>
 In my dry brain my spirit soon,<br>
 Down-deepening from swoon to swoon,<br>
 Faints like a dazzled morning moon.<br>
<br>
 The wind sounds like a silver wire,<br>
 And from beyond the noon a fire<br>
 Is pour'd upon the hills, and nigher<br>
 The skies stoop down in their desire;<br>
 And, isled in sudden seas of light,<br>
 My heart, pierced thro' with fierce delight,<br>
 Bursts into blossom in his sight.<br>
<br>
 My whole soul waiting silently,<br>
 All naked in a sultry sky,<br>
 Droops blinded with his shining eye:<br>
 I <i>will</i> possess him or will die.<br>
 I will grow round him in his place,<br>
 Grow, live, die looking on his face,<br>
 Die, dying clasp'd in his embrace.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section41">OEnone</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833, On being republished in 1842 this poem
was practically rewritten, the alterations and additions so
transforming the poem as to make it almost a new work. I have
therefore printed a complete transcript of the edition of 1833,
which the reader can compare. The final text is, with the
exception of one alteration which will be noticed, precisely that
of 1842, so there is no trouble with variants. <i>OEnone</i> is
the first of Tennyson's fine classical studies. The poem is
modelled partly on the Alexandrian Idyll, such an Idyll for
instance as the second Idyll of Theocritus or the <i>Megara</i>
or <i>Europa</i> of Moschus, and partly perhaps on the narratives
in the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid, to which the opening bears a
typical resemblance. It is possible that the poem may have been
suggested by Beattie's <i>Judgment of Paris</i> which tells the
same story, and tells it on the same lines on which it is told
here, though it is not placed in the mouth of OEnone. Beattie's
poem opens with an elaborate description of Ida and of Troy in
the distance. Paris, the husband of OEnone, is one afternoon
confronted with the three goddesses who are, as in Tennyson's
Idyll, elaborately delineated as symbolising what they here
symbolise. Each makes her speech and each offers what she has to
offer, worldly dominion, wisdom, sensual pleasure. There is, of
course, no comparison in point of merit between the two poems,
Beattie's being in truth perfectly commonplace. In its symbolic
aspect the poem may be compared with the temptations to which
Christ is submitted in <i>Paradise Regained</i>. See books iii.
and iv.<br>


<blockquote><a name="fgur"></a>There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier
 <a href="#fgu">1</a><br>
Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.<br>
The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen,<br>
Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine,<br>
And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand<br>
The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down<br>
Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars<br>
The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine<br>
 <a name="fgvr"></a>In cataract after cataract to the sea.<br>
Behind the valley topmost Gargarus  <a href="#fgv">2</a><br>
Stands up and takes the morning: but in front<br>
The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal<br>
Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel,<br>
The crown of Troas.<br>
Hither came at noon<br>
Mournful OEnone, wandering forlorn<br>
Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills.<br>
Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck<br>
Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest.<br>
She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine,<br>
Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade<br>
 <a name="fgwr"></a>Sloped downward to her seat from the upper
cliff.<br>
<br>
"O mother Ida, many-fountain'd  <a href="#fgw">3</a>  Ida,<br>
 <a name="fgxr"></a>Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
For now the noonday quiet holds the hill:  <a href=

 <a name="fgyr"></a>The grasshopper is silent in the grass;<br>

 <a name="fgzr"></a>The purple flowers droop: the golden bee<br>

<br>
 "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,<br>
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
Hear me O Earth, hear me O Hills, O Caves<br>
 <a name="fhbr"></a>That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain
brooks,<br>
I am the daughter of a River-God,  <a href="#fhb">8</a><br>
Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all<br>
 <a name="fhcr"></a>My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls<br>
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed,  <a href="#fhc">9</a><br>
A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be<br>
That, while I speak of it, a little while<br>
My heart may wander from its deeper woe.<br>
<br>
"O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,<br>
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
I waited underneath the dawning hills,<br>
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark,<br>
And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine:<br>
Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,<br>
 <a name="fhdr"></a>Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd,
white-hooved,<br>
Came up from reedy Simois  <a href="#fhd">10</a>  all alone.<br>
<br>
"O mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft:<br>
Far up the solitary morning smote<br>
The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes<br>
I sat alone: white-breasted like a star<br>
Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin<br>
Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair<br>
Cluster'd about his temples like a God's;<br>
And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens<br>
When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart<br>
Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came.<br>
"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm<br>
Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold,<br>
That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd<br>
And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech<br>
Came down upon my heart.<br>
<br>
"'My own OEnone,<br>
Beautiful-brow'd OEnone, my own soul,<br>
Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n<br>
"For the most fair," would seem to award it thine,<br>
As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt<br>
 <a name="fher"></a>The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace<br>
Of movement, and the charm of married brows.'  <a href=
"#fhe">11</a><br>
"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
He prest the blossom of his lips to mine,<br>
And added 'This was cast upon the board,<br>
When all the full-faced presence of the Gods<br>
Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon<br>
Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due:<br>
But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve,<br>
Delivering, that to me, by common voice<br>
Elected umpire, Her&egrave; comes to-day,<br>
Pallas and Aphrodite, claiming each<br>
This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave<br>
Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,<br>
Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard<br>
Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.'<br>
<br>
"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud<br>
Had lost his way between the piney sides<br>
Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came,<br>
 <a name="fhfr"></a>Naked they came to that smooth-swarded
bower,<br>
And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,  <a href=
"#fhf">12</a><br>
Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,<br>
Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose,<br>
And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,<br>
This way and that, in many a wild festoon<br>
Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs<br>
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.<br>
<br>
"O mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit,<br>
And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd<br>
Upon him, slowing dropping fragrant dew.<br>
Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom<br>
Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows<br>
Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods<br>
Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made<br>
Proffer of royal power, ample rule<br>
Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue<br>
Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale<br>
And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn,<br>
Or labour'd mines undrainable of ore.<br>
Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll,<br>
From many an inland town and haven large,<br>
Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel<br>
In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'<br>
<br>
"O mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
Still she spake on and still she spake of power,<br>
'Which in all action is the end of all;<br>
Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred<br>
And throned of wisdom &shy; from all neighbour crowns<br>
Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand<br>
Fail from the sceptre staff. Such boon from me,<br>
From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris to thee king-born,<br>
A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born,<br>
Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power<br>
Only, are likest gods, who have attain'd<br>
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats<br>
Above the thunder, with undying bliss<br>
In knowledge of their own supremacy.'<br>
<br>
"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit<br>
Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power<br>
Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood<br>
Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs<br>
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear<br>
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold,<br>
 <a name="fhgr"></a>The while, above, her full and earnest
eye<br>
Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek  <a href=
"#fhg">13</a><br>
Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.<br>
<br>
"'Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,<br>
These three alone lead life to sovereign power.<br>
Yet not for power, (power of herself<br>
Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law,<br>
 <a name="fhhr"></a>Acting the law we live by without fear;<br>
And, because right is right, to follow right  <a href=
"#fhh">14</a><br>
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'<br>
<br>
"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts.<br>
Sequel of guerdon could not alter me<br>
To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am,<br>
So shalt thou find me fairest. Yet indeed,<br>
If gazing on divinity disrobed<br>
Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair,<br>
Unbiass'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure<br>
 <a name="fhir"></a>That I shall love thee well and cleave to
thee,<br>
So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood,  <a href=
"#fhi">15</a><br>
Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's,<br>
To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks,<br>
Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow<br>
Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will.<br>
Circled thro' all experiences, pure law,<br>
Commeasure perfect freedom.' "Here she ceased,<br>
And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris,<br>
Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,<br>
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!<br>
<br>
"O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida.<br>
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
 <a name="fhjr"></a>Idalian Aphrodite, beautiful,<br>
Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian  <a href="#fhj">16</a> 
wells,<br>
 <a name="fhkr"></a>With rosy slender fingers backward drew<br>
From her warm brows and bosom  <a href="#fhk">17</a>  her deep
hair<br>
Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat<br>
And shoulder: from the violets her light foot<br>
Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form<br>
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches<br>
Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved.<br>
<br>
"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,<br>
The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh<br>
Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee<br>
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece'.<br>
She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear:<br>
But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm,<br>
And I beheld great Her&egrave;'s angry eyes,<br>
As she withdrew into the golden cloud,<br>
And I was left alone within the bower;<br>
And from that time to this I am alone,<br>
And I shall be alone until I die.<br>
<br>
"Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die.<br>
Fairest &shy; why fairest wife? am I not fair?<br>
My love hath told me so a thousand times.<br>
Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,<br>
When I past by, a wild and wanton pard,<br>
Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail<br>
Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she?<br>
Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms<br>
Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest<br>
Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew<br>
Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains<br>
Flash in the pools of whirling Simois.<br>
<br>
"O mother, hear me yet before I die.<br>
They came, they cut away my tallest pines,<br>
My dark tall pines, that plumed the craggy ledge<br>
High over the blue gorge, and all between<br>
The snowy peak and snow-white cataract<br>
Foster'd the callow eaglet &shy; from beneath<br>
Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn<br>
The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat<br>
Low in the valley. Never, never more<br>
Shall lone OEnone see the morning mist<br>
Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid<br>
With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud,<br>
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars.<br>
<br>
"O mother, here me yet before I die.<br>
I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds,<br>
Among the fragments tumbled from the glens,<br>
 <a name="fhlr"></a>Or the dry thickets, I could meet with
her,<br>
The Abominable,  <a href="#fhl">18</a>  that uninvited came<br>
Into the fair Pele&iuml;an banquet-hall,<br>
And cast the golden fruit upon the board,<br>
And bred this change; that I might speak my mind,<br>
And tell her to her face how much I hate<br>
Her presence, hated both of Gods and men.<br>
<br>
"O mother, here me yet before I die.<br>
Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,<br>
In this green valley, under this green hill,<br>

<br>
 There is a dale in Ida, lovelier<br>
Than any in old Ionia, beautiful<br>
With emerald slopes of sunny sward, that lean<br>
Above the loud glenriver, which hath worn<br>
A path thro' steepdown granite walls below<br>
Mantled with flowering tendriltwine. In front<br>
The cedarshadowy valleys open wide.<br>
Far-seen, high over all the God-built wall<br>
And many a snowycolumned range divine,<br>
Mounted with awful sculptures &shy; men and Gods,<br>
The work of Gods &shy; bright on the dark-blue sky<br>
The windy citadel of Ilion<br>
Shone, like the crown of Troas. Hither came<br>
Mournful OEnone wandering forlorn<br>
Of Paris, once her playmate. Round her neck,<br>
Her neck all marblewhite and marblecold,<br>
Floated her hair or seemed to float in rest.<br>
She, leaning on a vine-entwin&egrave;d stone,<br>
Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shadow<br>
Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff.<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,<br>
Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
The grasshopper is silent in the grass,<br>
 <a name="fhor"></a>The lizard with his shadow on the stone<br>
Sleeps like a shadow, and the scarletwinged  <a href=

Cicala in the noonday leapeth not<br>
Along the water-rounded granite-rock.<br>
The purple flower droops: the golden bee<br>
Is lilycradled: I alone awake.<br>
My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,<br>
My heart is breaking and my eyes are dim,<br>
And I am all aweary of my life.<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,<br>
Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
Hear me O Earth, hear me O Hills, O Caves<br>
That house the cold crowned snake! O mountain brooks,<br>
I am the daughter of a River-God,<br>
Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all<br>
My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls<br>
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed,<br>
A cloud that gathered shape: for it may be<br>
That, while I speak of it, a little while<br>
My heart may wander from its deeper woe.<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,<br>
Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewydark,<br>
And dewydark aloft the mountain pine;<br>
Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,<br>
Leading a jetblack goat whitehorned, whitehooved,<br>
Came up from reedy Simois all alone.<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
I sate alone: the goldensandalled morn<br>
Rosehued the scornful hills: I sate alone<br>
With downdropt eyes: white-breasted like a star<br>
Fronting the dawn he came: a leopard skin<br>
From his white shoulder drooped: his sunny hair<br>
Clustered about his temples like a God's:<br>
And his cheek brightened, as the foambow brightens<br>
When the wind blows the foam; and I called out,<br>
'Welcome Apollo, welcome home Apollo,<br>
Apollo, my Apollo, loved Apollo'.<br>
<br>
 "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
He, mildly smiling, in his milk-white palm<br>
Close-held a golden apple, lightningbright<br>
With changeful flashes, dropt with dew of Heaven<br>
Ambrosially smelling. From his lip,<br>
Curved crimson, the full-flowing river of speech<br>
Came down upon my heart.<br>
<br>
"' My own OEnone,<br>
Beautifulbrowed OEnone, mine own soul,<br>
Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n<br>
"For the most fair," in aftertime may breed<br>
Deep evilwilledness of heaven and sore<br>
Heartburning toward hallowed Ilion;<br>
And all the colour of my afterlife<br>
Will be the shadow of to-day. To-day<br>
Her&egrave; and Pallas and the floating grace<br>
Of laughter-loving Aphrodite meet<br>
In manyfolded Ida to receive<br>
This meed of beauty, she to whom my hand<br>
Award the palm. Within the green hillside,<br>
Under yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,<br>
Is an ingoing grotto, strown with spar<br>
And ivymatted at the mouth, wherein<br>
Thou unbeholden may'st behold, unheard<br>
Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.'<br>
<br>
 "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud<br>
Had lost his way between the piney hills.<br>
They came &shy; all three &shy; the Olympian goddesses.<br>
Naked they came to the smoothswarded bower,<br>
Lustrous with lilyflower, violeteyed<br>
Both white and blue, with lotetree-fruit thickset,<br>
Shadowed with singing-pine; and all the while,<br>
Above, the overwandering ivy and vine<br>
This way and that in many a wild festoon<br>
Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs<br>
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.<br>
On the treetops a golden glorious cloud<br>
Leaned, slowly dropping down ambrosial dew.<br>
How beautiful they were, too beautiful<br>
To look upon! but Paris was to me<br>
More lovelier than all the world beside.<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
First spake the imperial Olympian<br>
With arch&egrave;d eyebrow smiling sovranly,<br>
Fulley&egrave;d here. She to Paris made<br>
Proffer of royal power, ample rule<br>
Unquestioned, overflowing revenue<br>
Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale<br>
And river-sundered champaign clothed with corn,<br>
Or upland glebe wealthy in oil and wine &shy;<br>
Honour and homage, tribute, tax and toll,<br>
From many an inland town and haven large,<br>
Mast-thronged below her shadowing citadel<br>
In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
Still she spake on and still she spake of power<br>
'Which in all action is the end of all.<br>
Power fitted to the season, measured by<br>
The height of the general feeling, wisdomborn<br>
And throned of wisdom &shy; from all neighbour crowns<br>
Alliance and allegiance evermore. Such boon from me<br>
Heaven's Queen to thee kingborn,<br>
A shepherd all thy life and yet kingborn,<br>
Should come most welcome, seeing men, in this<br>
Only are likest gods, who have attained<br>
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats<br>
Above the thunder, with undying bliss<br>
In knowledge of their own supremacy;<br>
The changeless calm of undisputed right,<br>
The highest height and topmost strength of power.'<br>
<br>
 "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit<br>
Out at arm's length, so much the thought of power<br>
Flattered his heart: but Pallas where she stood<br>
Somewhat apart, her clear and bar&egrave;d limbs<br>
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear<br>
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold;<br>
The while, above, her full and earnest eye<br>
Over her snowcold breast and angry cheek<br>
Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.<br>
<br>
 "'Selfreverence, selfknowledge, selfcontrol<br>
Are the three hinges of the gates of Life,<br>
That open into power, everyway<br>
Without horizon, bound or shadow or cloud.<br>
Yet not for power (power of herself<br>
Will come uncalled-for) but to live by law<br>
Acting the law we live by without fear,<br>
And, because right is right, to follow right<br>
Were wisdom, in the scorn of consequence.<br>
<br>
 (Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.)<br>
Not as men value gold because it tricks<br>
And blazons outward Life with ornament,<br>
But rather as the miser, for itself.<br>
Good for selfgood doth half destroy selfgood.<br>
The means and end, like two coiled snakes, infect<br>
Each other, bound in one with hateful love.<br>
So both into the fountain and the stream<br>
A drop of poison falls. Come hearken to me,<br>
And look upon me and consider me,<br>
So shall thou find me fairest, so endurance,<br>
Like to an athlete's arm, shall still become<br>
Sinewed with motion, till thine active will<br>
(As the dark body of the Sun robed round<br>
With his own ever-emanating lights)<br>
Be flooded o'er with her own effluences,<br>
And thereby grow to freedom.' "Here she ceased<br>
And Paris pondered. I cried out, 'Oh, Paris,<br>
Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,<br>
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!<br>
<br>
 "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,<br>
Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
Idalian Aphrodite oceanborn,<br>
Fresh as the foam, newbathed in Paphian wells,<br>
With rosy slender fingers upward drew<br>
From her warm brow and bosom her dark hair<br>
Fragrant and thick, and on her head upbound<br>
In a purple band: below her lucid neck<br>
Shone ivorylike, and from the ground her foot<br>
Gleamed rosywhite, and o'er her rounded form<br>
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches<br>
Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved.<br>
<br>
 "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,<br>
The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh<br>
Half-whispered in his ear, 'I promise thee<br>
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece'.<br>
I only saw my Paris raise his arm:<br>
I only saw great Her&egrave;'s angry eyes,<br>
As she withdrew into the golden cloud,<br>
And I was left alone within the bower;<br>
And from that time to this I am alone.<br>
And I shall be alone until I die.<br>
<br>
 "Yet, mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
Fairest &shy; why fairest wife? am I not fair?<br>
My love hath told me so a thousand times.<br>
Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,<br>
When I passed by, a wild and wanton pard,<br>
Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail<br>
Crouched fawning in the weed. Most loving is she?<br>
Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms<br>
Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest<br>
Close-close to thine in that quickfalling dew<br>
Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains<br>
Flash in the pools of whirling Simois.<br>
<br>
 "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
They came, they cut away my tallest pines &shy;<br>
My dark tall pines, that plumed the craggy ledge<br>
High over the blue gorge, or lower down<br>
Filling greengulph&egrave;d Ida, all between<br>
The snowy peak and snowwhite cataract<br>
Fostered the callow eaglet &shy; from beneath<br>
Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark<br>
The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat<br>
Low in the valley. Never, nevermore<br>
Shall lone OEnone see the morning mist<br>
Sweep thro' them &shy; never see them overlaid<br>
With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud,<br>
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars.<br>
<br>
 "Oh! mother Ida, hearken ere I die.<br>
Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,<br>
In this green valley, under this green hill,<br>
Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone?<br>
Sealed it with kisses? watered it with tears?<br>
Oh happy tears, and how unlike to these!<br>
Oh happy Heaven, how can'st thou see my face?<br>
Oh happy earth, how can'st thou bear my weight?<br>
O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud,<br>
There are enough unhappy on this earth,<br>
Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:<br>
I pray thee, pass before my light of life.<br>
And shadow all my soul, that I may die.<br>
Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,<br>
Weigh heavy on my eyelids &shy; let me die.<br>

<h3><a name="section42">The Sisters</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833.<br>
<br>
The only alterations which have been made in it since have simply
consisted in the alteration of "'an'" for "and" in the third line
of each stanza, and "through and through" for "thro' and thro'"
in line 29, and "wrapt" for "wrapped" in line 34. It is curious
that in 1842 the original "bad" was altered to "bade," but all
subsequent editions keep to the original. It has been said that
this poem was founded on the old Scotch ballad "The Twa Sisters"
(see for that ballad Sharpe's <i>Ballad Book</i>, No. x., p. 30),
but there is no resemblance at all between the ballad and this
poem beyond the fact that in each there are two sisters who are
both loved by a certain squire, the elder in jealousy pushing the
younger into a river and drowning her.<br>


<blockquote>We were two daughters of one race:<br>
 She was the fairest in the face:<br>
 The wind is blowing in turret and tree.<br>
 They were together and she fell;<br>
 Therefore revenge became me well.<br>
 O the Earl was fair to see!<br>
<br>
 She died: she went to burning flame:<br>
 She mix'd her ancient blood with shame.<br>
 The wind is howling in turret and tree.<br>
 Whole weeks and months, and early and late,<br>
 To win his love I lay in wait:<br>
 O the Earl was fair to see!<br>
<br>
 I made a feast; I bad him come;<br>
 I won his love, I brought him home.<br>
 The wind is roaring in turret and tree.<br>
 And after supper, on a bed,<br>
 Upon my lap he laid his head:<br>
 O the Earl was fair to see!<br>
<br>
 I kiss'd his eyelids into rest:<br>
 His ruddy cheek upon my breast.<br>
 The wind is raging in turret and tree.<br>
 I hated him with the hate of hell,<br>
 But I loved his beauty passing well.<br>
 O the Earl was fair to see!<br>
<br>
 I rose up in the silent night:<br>
 I made my dagger sharp and bright.<br>
 The wind is raving in turret and tree.<br>
 As half-asleep his breath he drew,<br>
 Three times I stabb'd him thro' and thro'.<br>
 O the Earl was fair to see!<br>
<br>
 I curl'd and comb'd his comely head,<br>
 He look'd so grand when he was dead.<br>
 The wind is blowing in turret and tree.<br>
 I wrapt his body in the sheet,<br>
 And laid him at his mother's feet.<br>
 O the Earl was fair to see!</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section43">To &shy; &shy;</a></h3>

<br>
<b>with the following poem.</b><br>
<br>
I have not been able to ascertain to whom this dedication was
addressed. Sir Franklin Lushington tells me that he thinks it was
an imaginary person. The dedication explains the allegory
intended. The poem appears to have been suggested, as we learn
from <i>Tennyson's Life</i> (vol. i., p. 150), by a remark of
Trench to Tennyson when they were undergraduates at Trinity: "We
cannot live in art". It was the embodiment Tennyson added of his
belief "that the God-like life is with man and for man".
<i>Cf.</i> his own lines in <i>Love and Duty</i>: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>For a man is not as God,<br>
But then most God-like being most a man.</blockquote>

It is a companion poem to the <i>Vision of Sin</i>; in that poem
is traced the effect of indulgence in the grosser pleasures of
sense, in this the effect of the indulgence in the more refined
pleasures of sense.<br>


<blockquote><a name="fhpr"></a>I send you here a sort of
allegory,<br>
(For you will understand it) of a soul,  <a href="#fhp">1</a><br>
A sinful soul possess'd of many gifts,<br>
A spacious garden full of flowering weeds,<br>
A glorious Devil, large in heart and brain,<br>
That did love Beauty only, (Beauty seen<br>
In all varieties of mould and mind)<br>
And Knowledge for its beauty; or if Good,<br>
Good only for its beauty, seeing not<br>
That beauty, Good, and Knowledge, are three sisters<br>
That doat upon each other, friends to man,<br>
Living together under the same roof,<br>
And never can be sunder'd without tears.<br>
And he that shuts Love out, in turn shall be<br>
Shut out from Love, and on her threshold lie<br>
Howling in outer darkness. Not for this<br>
Was common clay ta'en from the common earth,<br>
Moulded by God, and temper'd with the tears<br>
Of angels to the perfect shape of man.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section44">The Palace of Art</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833, but altered so extensively on its
republication in 1842 as to be practically rewritten. The
alterations in it after 1842 were not numerous, consisting
chiefly in the deletion of two stanzas after line 192 and the
insertion of the three stanzas which follow in the present text,
together with other minor verbal corrections, all of which have
been noted. No alterations were made in the text after 1853. The
allegory Tennyson explains in the dedicatory verses, but the
framework of the poem was evidently suggested by
<i>Ecclesiastes</i> ii. 1-17. The position of the hero is
precisely that of Solomon. Both began by assuming that man is
self-sufficing and the world sufficient; the verdict of the one
in consequence being "vanity of vanities, all is vanity," of the
other what the poet here records. An admirable commentary on the
poem is afforded by Matthew Arnold's picture of the Romans before
Christ taught the secret of the only real happiness possible to
man. See <i>Obermann Once More</i>. The teaching of the poem has
been admirably explained by Spedding. It "represents
allegorically the condition of a mind which, in the love of
beauty and the triumphant consciousness of knowledge and
intellectual supremacy, in the intense enjoyment of its own power
and glory, has lost sight of its relation to man and God". See
<i>Tennyson's Life</i>, vol. i., p. 226.<br>


<blockquote>I built my soul a lordly pleasure-house<br>
 Wherein at ease for aye to dwell.<br>
 I said, "O Soul, make merry and carouse,<br>
 Dear soul, for all is well".<br>
<br>
 A huge crag-platform, smooth as burnish'd brass,<br>
 <a name="fhqr"></a>I chose. The ranged ramparts bright<br>
 From level meadow-bases of deep grass  <a href="#fhq">1</a><br>
 Suddenly scaled the light.<br>
<br>
 Thereon I built it firm. Of ledge or shelf<br>
 <a name="fhrr"></a>The rock rose clear, or winding stair.<br>
 <a name="fhsr"></a>My soul would live alone unto herself<br>
 <a name="fhtr"></a>In her high palace there.<br>
<br>
 And "while the world  <a href="#fhr">2</a>  runs round and
round,"<br>
 <a name="fhur"></a>I said, "Reign thou apart, a quiet king,<br>
 Still as, while Saturn  <a href="#fhs">3</a>  whirls, his
stedfast  <a href="#fht">4</a>  shade<br>
 Sleeps on his luminous  <a href="#fhu">5</a>  ring."<br>
<br>
 To which my soul made answer readily:<br>
 "Trust me, in bliss I shall abide<br>
 In this great mansion, that is built for me,<br>
 So royal-rich and wide"<br>
<br>
 ...<br>
<br>
 Four courts I made, East, West and South and North,<br>
 In each a squared lawn, wherefrom<br>
 <a name="fhvr"></a>The golden gorge of dragons spouted forth<br>
 A flood of fountain-foam.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 And round the cool green courts there ran a row<br>
 Of cloisters, branch'd like mighty woods,<br>
 Echoing all night to that sonorous flow<br>
 Of spouted fountain-floods.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 And round the roofs a gilded gallery<br>
 That lent broad verge to distant lands,<br>
 Far as the wild swan wings, to where the sky<br>
 Dipt down to sea and sands.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 From those four jets four currents in one swell<br>
 Across the mountain stream'd below<br>
 In misty folds, that floating as they fell<br>
 Lit up a torrent-bow.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 And high on every peak a statue seem'd<br>
 To hang on tiptoe, tossing up<br>
 A cloud of incense of all odour steam'd<br>
 From out a golden cup.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 So that she thought, "And who shall gaze upon<br>
 My palace with unblinded eyes,<br>
 While this great bow will waver in the sun,<br>
 And that sweet incense rise?"  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 For that sweet incense rose and never fail'd,<br>
 And, while day sank or mounted higher,<br>
 The light aerial gallery, golden-rail'd,<br>
 Burnt like a fringe of fire.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 Likewise the deep-set windows, stain'd and traced,<br>
 Would seem slow-flaming crimson fires<br>
 From shadow'd grots of arches interlaced,<br>
 And tipt with frost-like spires.  <a href="#fhv">6</a><br>
<br>
 ...<br>
<br>
 <a name="fhwr"></a>Full of long-sounding corridors it was,<br>
 That over-vaulted grateful gloom,  <a href="#fhw">7</a><br>
 Thro' which the livelong day my soul did pass,<br>
 Well-pleased, from room to room.<br>
<br>
 Full of great rooms and small the palace stood,<br>
 <a name="fhxr"></a>All various, each a perfect whole<br>
 From living Nature, fit for every mood  <a href="#fhx">8</a><br>
 And change of my still soul.<br>
<br>
 For some were hung with arras green and blue,<br>
 Showing a gaudy summer-morn,<br>
 <a name="fhyr"></a>Where with puff'd cheek the belted hunter
blew<br>
 His wreathed bugle-horn.  <a href="#fhy">9</a><br>
<br>
 One seem'd all dark and red &shy; a tract of sand,<br>
 And some one pacing there alone,<br>
 <a name="fhzr"></a>Who paced for ever in a glimmering land,<br>
 Lit with a low large moon.  <a href="#fhz">10</a><br>
<br>
 One show'd an iron coast and angry waves.<br>
 You seem'd to hear them climb and fall<br>
 <a name="fiar"></a>And roar rock-thwarted under bellowing
caves,<br>
 Beneath the windy wall.  <a href="#fia">11</a><br>
<br>
 And one, a full-fed river winding slow<br>
 By herds upon an endless plain,<br>
 The ragged rims of thunder brooding low,<br>
 With shadow-streaks of rain.  <a href="#fia">11</a><br>
<br>
 And one, the reapers at their sultry toil.<br>
 In front they bound the sheaves.<br>
 Behind Were realms of upland, prodigal in oil,<br>
 And hoary to the wind.  <a href="#fia">11</a><br>
<br>
 And one, a foreground black with stones and slags,<br>
 Beyond, a line of heights, and higher<br>
<a name="fibr"></a>All barr'd with long white cloud the scornful
crags,<br>
 And highest, snow and fire.  <a href="#fib">12</a><br>
<br>
 And one, an English home &shy; gray twilight pour'd<br>
 On dewy pastures, dewy trees,<br>
 <a name="ficr"></a>Softer than sleep &shy; all things in order
stored,<br>
 A haunt of ancient Peace.  <a href="#fic">13</a><br>
<br>
 Nor these alone, but every landscape fair,<br>
 As fit for every mood of mind,<br>
 <a name="fidr"></a>Or gay, or grave, or sweet, or stern, was
there,<br>
 Not less than truth design'd.  <a href="#fid">14</a><br>
<br>
 ...<br>
<br>
 Or the maid-mother by a crucifix,<br>
 In tracts of pasture sunny-warm,<br>
 <a name="fier"></a>Beneath branch-work of costly sardonyx<br>
 Sat smiling, babe in arm.  <a href="#fie">15</a><br>
<br>
 Or in a clear-wall'd city on the sea,<br>
 Near gilded organ-pipes, her hair<br>
 Wound with white roses, slept St. Cecily;<br>
 An angel look'd at her.<br>
<br>
 Or thronging all one porch of Paradise,<br>
 A group of Houris bow'd to see<br>
 <a name="fifr"></a>The dying Islamite, with hands and eyes<br>
 That said, We wait for thee.  <a href="#fif">16</a><br>
<br>
 Or mythic Uther's deeply-wounded son<br>
 In some fair space of sloping greens<br>
 <a name="figr"></a>Lay, dozing in the vale of Avalon,<br>
 And watch'd by weeping queens.  <a href="#fig">17</a><br>
<br>
 Or hollowing one hand against his ear,<br>
 To list a foot-fall, ere he saw<br>
 <a name="fihr"></a>The wood-nymph, stay'd the Ausonian king to
hear<br>
 Of wisdom and of law.  <a href="#fih">18</a><br>
<br>
 Or over hills with peaky tops engrail'd,<br>
 <a name="fiir"></a>And many a tract of palm and rice,<br>
 The throne of Indian Cama  <a href="#fii">19</a>  slowly
sail'd<br>
 A summer fann'd with spice.<br>
 <a name="fijr"></a><br>
 Or sweet Europa's  <a href="#fij">20</a>  mantle blew
unclasp'd,<br>
 From off her shoulder backward borne:<br>
 <a name="fikr"></a>From one hand droop'd a crocus: one hand
grasp'd<br>
 The mild bull's golden horn.  <a href="#fik">21</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="filr"></a>Or else flush'd Ganymede, his rosy thigh<br>
 <a name="fimr"></a>Half-buried in the Eagle's down,<br>
 <a name="finr"></a>Sole as a flying star shot thro' the sky<br>
 Above  <a href="#fil">22</a> the pillar'd town.<br>
<br>
 Nor  <a href="#fim">23</a> these alone: but every  <a href=
"#fin">24</a>  legend fair<br>
 Which the supreme Caucasian mind  <a href="#fio">25</a><br>
 <a name="fior"></a>Carved out of Nature for itself, was
there,<br>
 Not less than life, design'd.  <a href="#fip">26</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="fipr"></a> * * * *<br>
<br>
 Then in the towers I placed great bells that swung,<br>
 Moved of themselves, with silver sound;<br>
 And with choice paintings of wise men I hung<br>
 The royal dais round.<br>
<br>
 For there was Milton like a seraph strong,<br>
 Beside him Shakespeare bland and mild;<br>
 <a name="fiqr"></a>And there the world-worn Dante grasp'd his
song,<br>
 And somewhat grimly smiled.  <a href="#fiq">27</a><br>
<br>
 And there the Ionian father of the rest;  <a href=
"#fir1">28</a><br>
 <a name="firr1"></a>A million wrinkles carved his skin;<br>
 <a name="fisr"></a>A hundred winters snow'd upon his breast,<br>
 From cheek and throat and chin.  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 Above, the fair hall-ceiling stately set<br>
 Many an arch high up did lift,<br>
 And angels rising and descending met<br>
 With interchange of gift.  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 Below was all mosaic choicely plann'd<br>
 With cycles of the human tale<br>
 Of this wide world, the times of every land<br>
 So wrought, they will not fail.  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 The people here, a beast of burden slow,<br>
 Toil'd onward, prick'd with goads and stings;<br>
 Here play'd, a tiger, rolling to and fro<br>
 The heads and crowns of kings;  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 Here rose, an athlete, strong to break or bind<br>
 All force in bonds that might endure,<br>
 And here once more like some sick man declined,<br>
 And trusted any cure.  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 But over these she trod: and those great bells<br>
 Began to chime. She took her throne:<br>
 She sat betwixt the shining Oriels,<br>
 To sing her songs alone.  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 And thro' the topmost Oriels' colour'd flame<br>
 Two godlike faces gazed below;<br>
 Plato the wise, and large-brow'd Verulam,<br>
 The first of those who know.  <a href="#fis">29</a><br>
<br>
 And all those names, that in their motion were<br>
 Full-welling fountain-heads of change,<br>
 <a name="fitr"></a>Betwixt the slender shafts were blazon'd
fair<br>
 In diverse raiment strange:  <a href="#fit">30</a><br>
<br>
 Thro' which the lights, rose, amber, emerald, blue,<br>
 <a name="fiur"></a>Flush'd in her temples and her eyes,<br>
 And from her lips, as morn from Memnon,  <a href="#fiu">31</a> 
drew<br>
 Rivers of melodies.<br>
<br>
 No nightingale delighteth to prolong<br>
 Her low preamble all alone,<br>
 More than my soul to hear her echo'd song<br>
 Throb thro' the ribbed stone;<br>
<br>
 Singing and murmuring in her feastful mirth,<br>
 <a name="fivr"></a>Joying to feel herself alive,<br>
 Lord over Nature, Lord of  <a href="#fiv">32</a>  the visible
earth,<br>
 Lord of the senses five;<br>
<br>
 Communing with herself: "All these are mine,<br>
 And let the world have peace or wars,<br>
 Tis one to me". She &shy; when young night divine<br>
 Crown'd dying day with stars,<br>
<br>
 Making sweet close of his delicious toils &shy;<br>
 Lit light in wreaths and anadems,<br>
 And pure quintessences of precious oils<br>
 In hollow'd moons of gems,<br>
<br>
 To mimic heaven; and clapt her hands and cried,<br>
 "I marvel if my still delight<br>
 <a name="fiwr"></a>In this great house so royal-rich, and
wide,<br>
 Be flatter'd to the height.  <a href="#fiw">33</a><br>
<br>
 "O all things fair to sate my various eyes!<br>
 O shapes and hues that please me well!<br>
 <a name="fixr"></a>O silent faces of the Great and Wise,<br>
 My Gods, with whom I dwell!  <a href="#fix">34</a><br>
<br>
 "O God-like isolation which art mine,<br>
 I can but count thee perfect gain,<br>
 What time I watch the darkening droves of swine<br>
 That range on yonder plain.  <a href="#fix">34</a><br>
<br>
 "In filthy sloughs they roll a prurient skin,<br>
 They graze and wallow, breed and sleep;<br>
 And oft some brainless devil enters in,<br>
 And drives them to the deep."  <a href="#fix">34</a><br>
<br>
 Then of the moral instinct would she prate,<br>
 And of the rising from the dead,<br>
 As hers by right of full-accomplish'd Fate;<br>
 And at the last she said:<br>
<br>
 "I take possession of man's mind and deed.<br>
 I care not what the sects may brawl,<br>
 <a name="fiyr"></a>I sit as God holding no form of creed,<br>
 But contemplating all."  <a href="#fiy">35</a><br>
<br>
 * * *<br>
<br>
 Full oft  <a href="#fiz">36</a>  the riddle of the painful
earth<br>
 <a name="fizr"></a>Flash'd thro' her as she sat alone,<br>
 Yet not the less held she her solemn mirth,<br>
 And intellectual throne.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fjar"></a>And so she throve and prosper'd: so three
years<br>
 She prosper'd: on the fourth she fell,  <a href=
"#fja">37</a><br>
 Like Herod,  <a href="#fjb">38</a>  when the shout was in his
ears,<br>
 <a name="fjbr"></a>Struck thro' with pangs of hell.<br>
<br>
 Lest she should fail and perish utterly,<br>
 <a name="fjcr"></a>God, before whom ever lie bare<br>
 The abysmal deeps of Personality,  <a href="#fjc">39</a><br>
 Plagued her with sore despair.<br>
<br>
 When she would think, where'er she turn'd her sight,<br>
 The airy hand confusion wrought,<br>
 <a name="fjdr"></a>Wrote "Mene, mene," and divided quite<br>
 The kingdom of her thought.  <a href="#fjd">40</a><br>
<br>
 Deep dread and loathing of her solitude<br>
 Fell on her, from which mood was born<br>
 <a name="fjer"></a>Scorn of herself; again, from out that
mood<br>
 Laughter at her self-scorn.  <a href="#fje">41</a><br>
<br>
 "What! is not this my place of strength," she said,<br>
 "My spacious mansion built for me,<br>
 Whereof the strong foundation-stones were laid<br>
 Since my first memory? "<br>
<br>
 But in dark corners of her palace stood<br>
 Uncertain shapes; and unawares<br>
 On white-eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood,<br>
 And horrible nightmares,<br>
<br>
 And hollow shades enclosing hearts of flame,<br>
 And, with dim fretted foreheads all,<br>
 On corpses three-months-old at noon she came,<br>
 That stood against the wall.<br>
<br>
 A spot of dull stagnation, without light<br>
 <a name="fjfr"></a>Or power of movement, seem'd my soul,<br>
 'Mid onward-sloping  <a href="#fjf">42</a>  motions infinite<br>
 Making for one sure goal.<br>
<br>
 A still salt pool, lock'd in with bars of sand;<br>
 Left on the shore; that hears all night<br>
 The plunging seas draw backward from the land<br>
 Their moon-led waters white.<br>
<br>
 A star that with the choral starry dance<br>
 Join'd not, but stood, and standing saw<br>
 The hollow orb of moving Circumstance<br>
 Roll'd round by one fix'd law.<br>
<br>
 Back on herself her serpent pride had curl'd.<br>
 "No voice," she shriek'd in that lone hall,<br>
 "No voice breaks thro' the stillness of this world:<br>
 One deep, deep silence all!"<br>
<br>
 She, mouldering with the dull earth's mouldering sod,<br>
 Inwrapt tenfold in slothful shame,<br>
 Lay there exiled from eternal God,<br>
 Lost to her place and name;<br>
<br>
 And death and life she hated equally,<br>
 And nothing saw, for her despair,<br>
 But dreadful time, dreadful eternity,<br>
 No comfort anywhere;<br>
<br>
 Remaining utterly confused with fears,<br>
 And ever worse with growing time,<br>
 And ever unrelieved by dismal tears,<br>
 And all alone in crime:<br>
<br>
 Shut up as in a crumbling tomb, girt round<br>
 With blackness as a solid wall,<br>
 Far off she seem'd to hear the dully sound<br>
 Of human footsteps fall.<br>
<br>
 As in strange lands a traveller walking slow,<br>
 In doubt and great perplexity,<br>
 A little before moon-rise hears the low<br>
 Moan of an unknown sea;<br>
<br>
 <a name="fjgr"></a>And knows not if it be thunder or a sound<br>
 Of rocks  <a href="#fjg">43</a>  thrown down, or one deep
cry<br>
 Of great wild beasts; then thinketh, "I have found<br>
 A new land, but I die".<br>
<br>
 She howl'd aloud, "I am on fire within.<br>
 There comes no murmur of reply.<br>
 What is it that will take away my sin,<br>
 And save me lest I die?"<br>
<br>
 So when four years were wholly finished,<br>
 She threw her royal robes away.<br>
 <a name="fjhr"></a>"Make me a cottage in the vale," she
said,<br>
 "Where I may mourn and pray.  <a href="#fjh">44</a><br>
<br>
 "Yet pull not down my palace towers, that are<br>
 So lightly, beautifully built:<br>
 <a name="fjir"></a>Perchance I may return with others there<br>
 When I have purged my guilt."  <a href=

 When I first conceived the plan of the Palace of Art, I intended
to have introduced both sculptures and paintings into it; but it
is the most difficult of all things to <i>devise</i> a statue in
verse. Judge whether I have succeeded in the statues of Elijah
and Olympias.

<blockquote>One was the Tishbite whom the raven fed,<br>
As when he stood on Carmel steeps,<br>
With one arm stretched out bare, and mocked and said,<br>
"Come cry aloud-he sleeps".<br>
<br>
 Tall, eager, lean and strong, his cloak wind-borne<br>
Behind, his forehead heavenly bright<br>
From the clear marble pouring glorious scorn,<br>
Lit as with inner light.<br>
<br>
 One, was Olympias: the floating snake<br>
Rolled round her ancles, round her waist<br>
Knotted, and folded once about her neck,<br>
Her perfect lips to taste.<br>
<br>
 Round by the shoulder moved: she seeming blythe<br>
Declined her head: on every side<br>
The dragon's curves melted and mingled with<br>
The woman's youthful pride<br>
Of rounded limbs.<br>
<br>
 Or Venus in a snowy shell alone,<br>
Deep-shadowed in the glassy brine,<br>
Moonlike glowed double on the blue, and shone<br>
A naked shape divine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So that my soul beholding in her pride<br>
All these, from room to room did pass;<br>
And all things that she saw, she multiplied,<br>
A many-faced glass.<br>
<br>
 And, being both the sower and the seed,<br>
Remaining in herself became<br>
All that she saw, Madonna, Ganymede,<br>
Or the Asiatic dame &shy;<br>
<br>
 Still changing, as a lighthouse in the night<br>
Changeth athwart the gleaming main,<br>
From red to yellow, yellow to pale white,<br>
Then back to red again.<br>
<br>
 "From change to change four times within the womb<br>
The brain is moulded," she began,<br>
"So thro' all phases of all thought I come<br>
Into the perfect man.<br>

 "All nature widens upward: evermore<br>
The simpler essence lower lies,<br>
More complex is more perfect, owning more<br>

 "I take possession of men's minds and deeds.<br>

In each a squar&egrave;d lawn where from<br>
A golden-gorged dragon spouted forth<br>
The fountain's diamond foam.<br>

 All round the cool green courts there ran a row<br>
Of cloisters, branched like mighty woods,<br>
Echoing all night to that sonorous flow<br>
Of spouted fountain floods.<br>
<br>
 From those four jets four currents in one swell<br>
Over the black rock streamed below<br>
In steamy folds, that, floating as they fell,<br>
Lit up a torrent bow.<br>
<br>
 And round the roofs ran gilded galleries<br>
That gave large view to distant lands,<br>
Tall towns and mounds, and close beneath the skies<br>
Long lines of amber sands.<br>
<br>
 Huge incense-urns along the balustrade,<br>
Hollowed of solid amethyst,<br>
Each with a different odour fuming, made<br>
The air a silver mist.<br>
<br>
 Far-off 'twas wonderful to look upon<br>
Those sumptuous towers between the gleam<br>
Of that great foam-bow trembling in the sun,<br>
And the argent incense-steam;<br>
<br>
 And round the terraces and round the walls,<br>
While day sank lower or rose higher,<br>
To see those rails with all their knobs and balls,<br>
Burn like a fringe of fire.<br>

<h3><a name="section45">Lady Clara Vere de Vere</a></h3>

<br>
Though this is placed among the poems published in 1833 it first
appeared in print in 1842. The subsequent alterations were very
slight, and after 1848 none at all were made.<br>


<blockquote>Lady Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 Of me you shall not win renown:<br>
 You thought to break a country heart<br>
 For pastime, ere you went to town.<br>
 At me you smiled, but unbeguiled<br>
 I saw the snare, and I retired:<br>
 The daughter of a hundred Earls,<br>
 You are not one to be desired.<br>
<br>
 Lady Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 I know you proud to bear your name,<br>
 Your pride is yet no mate for mine,<br>
 Too proud to care from whence I came.<br>
 Nor would I break for your sweet sake<br>
 A heart that doats on truer charms.<br>
 A simple maiden in her flower<br>
 Is worth a hundred coats-of-arms.<br>
<br>
 Lady Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 Some meeker pupil you must find,<br>
 For were you queen of all that is,<br>
 I could not stoop to such a mind.<br>
 You sought to prove how I could love,<br>
 And my disdain is my reply.<br>
 The lion on your old stone gates<br>
 Is not more cold to you than I.<br>
<br>
 Lady Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 You put strange memories in my head.<br>
 Not thrice your branching limes have blown<br>
 Since I beheld young Laurence dead.<br>
 Oh your sweet eyes, your low replies:<br>
 A great enchantress you may be;<br>
 But there was that across his throat<br>
 Which you hardly cared to see.<br>
<br>
 Lady Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 When thus he met his mother's view,<br>
 She had the passions of her kind,<br>
 She spake some certain truths of you.<br>
<br>
 Indeed I heard one bitter word<br>
 That scarce is fit for you to hear;<br>
 Her manners had not that repose<br>
 Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.<br>
<br>
 Lady Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 There stands a spectre in your hall:<br>
 The guilt of blood is at your door:<br>
 You changed a wholesome heart to gall.<br>
 You held your course without remorse,<br>
 To make him trust his modest worth,<br>
 And, last, you fix'd a vacant stare,<br>
 And slew him with your noble birth.<br>
<br>
 Trust me, Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 <a name="fjjr"></a> From yon blue heavens above us bent<br>
 The grand old gardener and his wife  <a href="#fjj">1</a><br>
 Smile at the claims of long descent.<br>
 Howe'er it be, it seems to me,<br>
 'Tis only noble to be good.<br>
 Kind hearts are more than coronets,<br>
 And simple faith than Norman blood.<br>
<br>
 I know you, Clara Vere de Vere:<br>
 You pine among your halls and towers:<br>
 The languid light of your proud eyes<br>
 Is wearied of the rolling hours.<br>
 In glowing health, with boundless wealth,<br>
 But sickening of a vague disease,<br>
 You know so ill to deal with time,<br>
 You needs must play such pranks as these.<br>
<br>
 Clara, Clara Vere de Vere,<br>
 If Time be heavy on your hands,<br>
 Are there no beggars at your gate,<br>
 Nor any poor about your lands?<br>
 Oh! teach the orphan-boy to read,<br>
 Or teach the orphan-girl to sew,<br>
 Pray Heaven for a human heart,<br>
 And let the foolish yoeman go.</blockquote>

 They call me cruel-hearted, but I care not what they say,<br>
 For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.<br>
<br>
 They say he's dying all for love, but that can never be:<br>
 They say his heart is breaking, mother &shy; what is that to
me?<br>
 There's many a bolder lad 'ill woo me any summer day,<br>
 And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.<br>
<br>
 Little Effie shall go with me to-morrow to the green,<br>
 And you'll be there, too, mother, to see me made the Queen;<br>
 For the shepherd lads on every side 'ill come from far away,<br>
 And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.<br>
<br>
 The honeysuckle round the porch has wov'n its wavy bowers,<br>
 And by the meadow-trenches blow the faint sweet
cuckoo-flowers;<br>
 And the wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in swamps and
hollows gray,<br>
 And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.<br>
<br>
 The night-winds come and go, mother, upon the meadow-grass,<br>
 And the happy stars above them seem to brighten as they
pass;<br>
 There will not be a drop of rain the whole of the live-long
day,<br>
 And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.<br>
<br>
 All the valley, mother, 'ill be fresh and green and still,<br>
 And the cowslip and the crowfoot are over all the hill,<br>
 And the rivulet in the flowery dale 'ill merrily glance and
play,<br>
 For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.<br>
<br>
 So you must wake and call me early, call me early, mother
dear,<br>
 To-morrow 'ill be the happiest time of all the glad
New-year:<br>
 To-morrow 'ill be of all the year the maddest merriest day,<br>
 For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the
May.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section47">New Year's Eve</a></h3>

<br>
<blockquote>If you're waking call me early, call me early, mother
dear,<br>
 For I would see the sun rise upon the glad New-year.<br>
 It is the last New-year that I shall ever see,<br>
 Then you may lay me low i' the mould and think no more of
me.<br>
<br>
 To-night I saw the sun set: he set and left behind<br>
 The good old year, the dear old time, and all my peace of
mind;<br>
 <a name="fjnr"></a>And the New-year's coming up, mother, but I
shall never see<br>
 The blossom on  <a href="#fjn">1</a>  the blackthorn, the leaf
upon the tree.<br>
<br>
 Last May we made a crown of flowers: we had a merry day;<br>
 Beneath the hawthorn on the green they made me Queen of May;<br>
 And we danced about the may-pole and in the hazel copse,<br>
 Till Charles's Wain came out above the tall white
chimney-tops.<br>
<br>
 There's not a flower on all the hills: the frost is on the
pane:<br>
 I only wish to live till the snowdrops come again:<br>
 I wish the snow would melt and the sun come out on high:<br>
 I long to see a flower so before the day I die.<br>
<br>
 The building rook'll caw from the windy tall elm-tree,<br>
 And the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea,<br>
 And the swallow'll come back again with summer o'er the
wave.<br>
 But I shall lie alone, mother, within the mouldering grave.<br>
<br>
 Upon the chancel-casement, and upon that grave of mine,<br>
 In the early, early morning the summer sun'll shine,<br>
 Before the red cock crows from the farm upon the hill,<br>
 When you are warm-asleep, mother, and all the world is
still.<br>
<br>
 When the flowers come again, mother, beneath the waning
light<br>
 <a name="fjor"></a>You'll never see me more in the long gray
fields at night;<br>
 <a name="fjpr"></a>When from the dry dark wold the summer airs
blow cool<br>
 <a name="fjqr"></a>On the oat-grass and the sword-grass, and the
bulrush in the pool.<br>
<br>
 You'll bury me,  <a href="#fjo">2</a>  my mother, just beneath
the hawthorn shade,<br>
 And you'll come  <a href="#fjp">3</a>  sometimes and see me
where I am lowly laid.<br>
 I shall not forget you, mother, I shall hear you when you pass,
 <a href="#fjq">4</a><br>
 <a name="fjrr"></a>With your feet above my head in the long and
pleasant grass.<br>
<br>
 I have been wild and wayward, but you'll forgive  <a href=
"#fjr">5</a>  me now;<br>
 <a name="fjsr"></a>You'll kiss me, my own mother, and forgive me
ere I go;  <a href="#fjs">6</a><br>
 <a name="fjtr"></a>Nay, nay, you must not weep,  <a href=
"#fjt">7</a>  nor let your grief be wild,<br>
 <a name="fjur"></a>You should not fret for me, mother, you  <a
href="#fju">8</a>  have another child.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fjvr"></a>If I can I'll come again, mother, from out my
resting-place;<br>
 Tho' you'll  <a href="#fjv">9</a>  not see me, mother, I shall
look upon your face;<br>
 <a name="fjwr"></a>Tho' I cannot speak a word, 1 shall harken
what you  <a href="#fjw">10</a>  say,<br>
 <a name="fjxr"></a>And be often, often with you when you think
 <a href="#fjx">11</a>  I'm far away.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fjyr"></a>Good-night, good-night, when I have said
good-night for evermore,<br>
 And you  <a href="#fjy">12</a>  see me carried out from the
threshold of the door;<br>
 Don't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing
green:<br>
 She'll be a better child to you than ever I have been.<br>
<br>
 She'll find my garden-tools upon the granary floor:<br>
 Let her take 'em: they are hers: I shall never garden more:<br>
 But tell her, when I'm gone, to train the rose-bush that I
set<br>
 <a name="fjzr"></a>About the parlour-window and the box of
mignonette.<br>
<br>
 Good-night, sweet mother: call me before the day is born.  <a
href="#fjz">13</a><br>
 All night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn;<br>
 But I would see the sun rise upon the glad New-year,<br>
 So, if your waking, call me, call me early, mother
dear.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section48">Conclusion</a></h3>

<br>
Added in 1842.<br>


<blockquote>I thought to pass away before, and yet alive I
am;<br>
 And in the fields all round I hear the bleating of the lamb.<br>
 How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!<br>
 To die before the snowdrop came, and now the violet's here.<br>
<br>
 O sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies,<br>
 And sweeter is the young lamb's voice to me that cannot
rise,<br>
 And sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that
blow,<br>
 And sweeter far is death than life to me that long to go.<br>
<br>
 It seem'd so hard at first, mother, to leave the blessed
sun,<br>
 And now it seems as hard to stay, and yet His will be done!<br>
 <a name="fkar"></a>But still I think it can't be long before I
find release;<br>
 And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of peace.
 <a href="#fka">1</a><br>
<br>
 O blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair!<br>
 And blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me
there!<br>
 O blessings on his kindly heart and on his silver head!<br>
 <a name="fkbr"></a>A thousand times I blest him, as he knelt
beside my bed.<br>
<br>
 He taught me all the mercy, for he show'd  <a href="#fkb">2</a> 
me all the sin.<br>
 Now, tho' my lamp was lighted late, there's One will let me
in:<br>
 Nor would I now be well, mother, again, if that could be,<br>
 For my desire is but to pass to Him that died for me.<br>
<br>
 I did not hear the dog howl, mother, or the death-watch
beat,<br>
 There came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet:<br>
 But sit beside my bed, mother, and put your hand in mine,<br>
 And Effie on the other side, and I will tell the sign.<br>
<br>
 All in the wild March-morning I heard the angels call;<br>
 It was when the moon was setting, and the dark was over all;<br>
 The trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll,<br>
 And in the wild March-morning I heard them call my soul.<br>
<br>
 For lying broad awake I thought of you and Effie dear;<br>
 I saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here;<br>
 With all my strength I pray'd for both, and so I felt
resign'd,<br>
 And up the valley came a swell of music on the wind.<br>
<br>
 I thought that it was fancy, and I listen'd in my bed,<br>
 And then did something speak to me &shy; I know not what was
said;<br>
 For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind,<br>
 And up the valley came again the music on the wind.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fkcr"></a>But you were sleeping; and I said, "It's not
for them: it's mine".<br>
 And if it comes  <a href="#fkc">3</a>  three times, I thought, I
take it for a sign.<br>
 And once again it came, and close beside the window-bars,<br>
 Then seem'd to go right up to Heaven and die among the
stars.<br>
<br>
 So now I think my time is near. I trust it is. I know<br>
 The blessed music went that way my soul will have to go.<br>
 And for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day.<br>
 <a name="fkdr"></a>But, Effie, you must comfort <i>her</i> when
I am past away.<br>
<br>
 And say to Robin  <a href="#fkd">4</a>  a kind word, and tell
him not to fret;<br>
 There's many worthier than I, would make him happy yet.<br>
 If I had lived &shy; I cannot tell &shy; I might have been his
wife;<br>
 But all these things have ceased to be, with my desire of
life.<br>
<br>
 O look! the sun begins to rise, the heavens are in a glow;<br>
 He shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know.<br>
 And there I move no longer now, and there his light may shine
&shy;<br>
 Wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine.<br>
<br>
 O sweet and strange it seems to me, that ere this day is
done<br>
 The voice, that now is speaking, may be beyond the sun &shy;<br>
 For ever and for ever with those just souls and true &shy;<br>
 And what is life, that we should moan? why make we such ado?<br>
<br>
 For ever and for ever, all in a blessed home &shy;<br>
 And there to wait a little while till you and Effie come
&shy;<br>
 To lie within the light of God, as I lie upon your breast
&shy;<br>
 And the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at
rest.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section49">The Lotos Eaters</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833, but when republished in 1842 the
alterations in the way of excision, alteration, and addition were
very extensive. The text of 1842 is practically the final text.
This charming poem is founded on <i>Odyssey</i>, ix., 82
<i>seq.</i><br>


<blockquote>"On the tenth day we set foot on the land of the
lotos-eaters who eat a flowery food. So we stepped ashore and
drew water.... When we had tasted meat and drink I sent forth
certain of my company to go and make search what manner of men
they were who here live upon the earth by bread.... Then
straightway they went and mixed with the men of the lotos-eaters,
and so it was that the lotos-eaters devised not death for our
fellows but gave them of the lotos to taste. Now whosoever of
them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotos had no more wish
to bring tidings nor to come back, but there he chose to abide
with the lotos-eating men ever feeding on the lotos and forgetful
of his homeward way. Therefore I led them back to the ships
weeping and sore against their will ... lest haply any should eat
of the lotos and be forgetful of returning."<br>
<br>
 (Lang and Butcher's translation.)</blockquote>

<br>
But in the details of his poem Tennyson has laid many other poets
under contribution, notably Moschus, <i>Idyll</i>, v.; Bion,
<i>Idyll</i>, v.; Spenser, <i>Faerie Queen</i>, II. vi.
(description of the <i>Idle Lake</i>), and Thomson's <i>Castle of
Indolence</i>.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>"Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land,<br>
 "This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon."<br>
 In the afternoon they came unto a land,<br>
 In which it seemed always afternoon.<br>
 All round the coast the languid air did swoon,<br>
 <a name="fker"></a>Breathing like one that hath a weary
dream.<br>
 Full-faced above the valley stood the moon;  <a href=
"#fke">1</a><br>
 And like a downward smoke, the slender stream<br>
 Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.<br>
<br>
 A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,<br>
 Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;<br>
 And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,<br>
 <a name="fkfr"></a>Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.<br>
 They saw the gleaming river seaward flow  <a href=
"#fkf">2</a><br>
 <a name="fkgr"></a>From the inner land: far off, three
mountain-tops,<br>
 Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,  <a href="#fkg">3</a><br>
 Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops,<br>
 Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.<br>
<br>
 The charmed sunset linger'd low adown<br>
 In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale<br>
 Was seen far inland, and the yellow down<br>
 Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale<br>
 And meadow, set with slender galingale;<br>
 A land where all things always seem'd the same!<br>
 And round about the keel with faces pale,<br>
 Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,<br>
 The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.<br>
<br>
 Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,<br>
 Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave<br>
 To each, but whoso did receive of them,<br>
 And taste, to him the gushing of the wave<br>
 Far far away did seem to mourn and rave<br>
 On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,<br>
 His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;<br>
 And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,<br>
 And music in his ears his beating heart did make.<br>
<br>
 They sat them down upon the yellow sand,<br>
 Between the sun and moon upon the shore;<br>
 And sweet it was to dream of Father-land,<br>
 Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore<br>
 Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar,<br>
 Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.<br>
 Then some one said, "We will return no more";<br>
 And all at once they sang, "Our island home<br>
 Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam".<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>Choric Song</b><br>
<br>
 1<br>
<br>
 There is sweet music here that softer falls<br>
 Than petals from blown roses on the grass,<br>
 Or night-dews on still waters between walls<br>
 Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;<br>
 Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,<br>
 Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes;<br>
 Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.<br>
 Here are cool mosses deep,<br>
 And thro' the moss the ivies creep,<br>
 And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,<br>
 And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
 2<br>
<br>
 Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness,<br>
 And utterly consumed with sharp distress,<br>
 While all things else have rest from weariness?<br>
 All things have rest: why should we toil alone,<br>
 We only toil, who are the first of things,<br>
 And make perpetual moan,<br>
 Still from one sorrow to another thrown:<br>
 Nor ever fold our wings,<br>
 And cease from wanderings,<br>
 Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm;<br>
 Nor harken what the inner spirit sings,<br>
 "There is no joy but calm!"<br>
 Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?<br>
<br>
<br>
 3<br>
<br>
 Lo! in the middle of the wood,<br>
 The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud<br>
 With winds upon the branch, and there<br>
 Grows green and broad, and takes no care,<br>
 Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon<br>
 Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow<br>
 Falls, and floats adown the air.<br>
 Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,<br>
 The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,<br>
 Drops in a silent autumn night.<br>
 All its allotted length of days,<br>
 The flower ripens in its place,<br>
 Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil,<br>
 Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil.<br>
<br>
<br>
 4<br>
<br>
 <a name="fkhr"></a>Hateful is the dark-blue sky,<br>
 Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea.  <a href="#fkh">4</a><br>
 Death is the end of life; ah, why<br>
 Should life all labour be?<br>
 Let us alone.<br>
 Time driveth onward fast,<br>
 And in a little while our lips are dumb.<br>
 Let us alone.<br>
 What is it that will last?<br>
 All things are taken from us, and become<br>
 Portions and parcels of the dreadful Past.<br>
 Let us alone.<br>
 <a name="fkir"></a>What pleasure can we have<br>
 <a name="fkjr"></a>To war with evil? Is there any peace<br>
 In ever climbing up the climbing wave?  <a href="#fki">5</a><br>
 All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave  <a href=
"#fkj">6</a><br>
 In silence; ripen, fall and cease:<br>
 Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.<br>
<br>
<br>
 5<br>
<br>
 How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,<br>
 With half-shut eyes ever to seem<br>
 Falling asleep in a half-dream!<br>
 To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,<br>
 Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;<br>
 To hear each other's whisper'd speech:<br>
 Eating the Lotos day by day,<br>
 To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,<br>
 And tender curving lines of creamy spray;<br>
 To lend our hearts and spirits wholly<br>
 To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;<br>
 <a name="fkkr"></a>To muse and brood and live again in
memory,<br>
 With those  <a href="#fkk">7</a>  old faces of our infancy<br>
 Heap'd over with a mound of grass,<br>
 Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!<br>
<br>
<br>
 6<br>
<br>
 Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,<br>
 And dear the last embraces of our wives<br>
 And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change;<br>
 For surely now our household hearths are cold:<br>
 Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:<br>
 And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.<br>
 Or else the island princes over-bold<br>
 Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings<br>
 Before them of the ten-years' war in Troy,<br>
 <a name="fklr"></a>And our great deeds, as half-forgotten
things.<br>
 Is there confusion in the little isle?  <a href="#fkl">8</a><br>
 Let what is broken so remain.<br>
 The Gods are hard to reconcile:<br>
 'Tis hard to settle order once again.<br>
 There <i>is</i> confusion worse than death,<br>
 <a name="fkmr"></a>Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,<br>
 <a name="fknr"></a>Long labour unto aged breath,<br>
 Sore task to hearts worn out with  <a href="#fkm">9</a>  many
wars<br>
 And eyes grow dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.  <a href=

<br>
 <a name="fkor"></a>7<br>
<br>
 But, propt on beds  <a href="#fko">11</a>  of amaranth and
moly,<br>
 How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly)<br>
 With half-dropt eyelids still,<br>
 Beneath a heaven dark and holy,<br>
 To watch the long bright river drawing slowly<br>
 His waters from the purple hill &shy;<br>
 To hear the dewy echoes calling<br>
 <a name="fkpr"></a>From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine
&shy;<br>
 To watch  <a href="#fkp">12</a>  the emerald-colour'd water
falling<br>
 Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine!<br>
 Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,<br>

 The Lotos blooms below the barren peak:  <a href=
"#fkq">13</a><br>
 The Lotos blows by every winding creek:<br>
 All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone:<br>
 Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone<br>
 Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is
blown.<br>
 We have had enough of action, and of motion we,<br>
 Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was
seething free,<br>
 Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the
sea.<br>
 Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,<br>
 In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined<br>
 On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.<br>
 For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd<br>
 Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly
curl'd<br>
 Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world:<br>
 Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands,<br>
 Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and
fiery sands,<br>
 Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships and
praying hands.<br>
 But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song<br>
 Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,<br>
 Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong;<br>
 Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,<br>
 Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,<br>
 Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;<br>
 Till they perish and they suffer &shy; some,'tis whisper'd &shy;
down in hell<br>
 Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,<br>
 Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.<br>
 Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore<br>
 <a name="fkrr1"></a>Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and
wave and oar;<br>
 Oh rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more.  <a href=

 Weariness and wild alarm,<br>
 Tossing on the tossing ocean,<br>
 Where the tusked sea-horse walloweth<br>
 In a stripe of grass-green calm,<br>
 At noontide beneath the lee;<br>

 His foam-fountains in the sea.<br>
 Long enough the wine-dark wave our weary bark did carry.<br>
 This is lovelier and sweeter,<br>
 Men of Ithaca, this is meeter,<br>
 In the hollow rosy vale to tarry,<br>

 We will eat the Lotos, sweet<br>
 As the yellow honeycomb,<br>
 In the valley some, and some<br>
 On the ancient heights divine;<br>
 And no more roam,<br>
 On the loud hoar foam,<br>
 To the melancholy home<br>
 At the limit of the brine,<br>
 The little isle of Ithaca, beneath the day's decline.<br>
 We'll lift no more the shattered oar,<br>
No more unfurl the straining sail;<br>
 With the blissful Lotos-eaters pale<br>
 We will abide in the golden vale<br>
 Of the Lotos-land till the Lotos fail;<br>
 We will not wander more.<br>
 Hark! how sweet the horned ewes bleat<br>
 On the solitary steeps,<br>
 And the merry lizard leaps,<br>
 And the foam-white waters pour;<br>
 And the dark pine weeps,<br>
 And the lithe vine creeps,<br>
 And the heavy melon sleeps<br>
 On the level of the shore:<br>
 Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will not wander more,<br>
 Surely, surely slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore<br>
 Than labour in the ocean, and rowing with the oar,<br>
 Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will return no more.</blockquote>

The fine picture in the text of the gods of Epicurus was no doubt
immediately suggested by <i>Lucretius</i>, iii., 15 <i>seq.</i>,
while the <i>Icaromenippus</i> of Lucian furnishes an excellent
commentary on Tennyson's picture of those gods and what they see.

<h3><a name="section50">A Dream of Fair Women</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1833 but very extensively altered on its
republication in 1842. It had been written by June, 1832, and
appears to have been originally entitled <i>Legend of Fair
Women</i> (see Spedding's letter dated 21st June, 1832,
<i>Life</i>, i., 116). In nearly every edition between 1833 and
1853 it was revised, and perhaps no poem proves more strikingly
the scrupulous care which Tennyson took to improve what he
thought susceptible of improvement. The work which inspired it,
Chaucer's <i>Legend of Good Women</i>, was written about 1384,
thus "preluding" by nearly two hundred years the "spacious times
of great Elizabeth". There is no resemblance between the poems
beyond the fact that both are visions and both have as their
heroines illustrious women who have been unfortunate. Cleopatra
is the only one common to the two poems. Tennyson's is an
exquisite work of art &shy; the transition from the anarchy of
dreams to the dreamland landscape and to the sharply denned
figures &shy; the skill with which the heroines (what could be
more perfect that Cleopatra and Jephtha's daughter?) are chosen
and contrasted &shy; the wonderful way in which the Iphigenia of
Euripides and Lucretius and the Cleopatra of Shakespeare are
realised are alike admirable. The poem opened in 1833 with the
following strangely irrelevant verses, excised in 1842, which as
Fitzgerald observed "make a perfect poem by themselves without
affecting the 'dream '": &shy; <br>


<blockquote>As when a man, that sails in a balloon,<br>
Downlooking sees the solid shining ground<br>
Stream from beneath him in the broad blue noon,<br>
Tilth, hamlet, mead and mound:<br>
<br>
 And takes his flags and waves them to the mob,<br>
That shout below, all faces turned to where<br>
Glows ruby-like the far up crimson globe,<br>
Filled with a finer air:<br>
<br>
 So lifted high, the Poet at his will<br>
Lets the great world flit from him, seeing all,<br>
Higher thro' secret splendours mounting still,<br>
Self-poised, nor fears to fall.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Hearing apart the echoes of his fame.<br>
 While I spoke thus, the seedsman, memory,<br>
 Sowed my deepfurrowed thought with many a name,<br>
 Whose glory will not die.<br>
<br>
 I read, before my eyelids dropt their shade,<br>
 <a name="fksr"></a><i>"The Legend of Good Women,"</i> long
ago<br>
 Sung by the morning star  <a href="#fks">1</a>  of song, who
made<br>
 His music heard below;<br>
<br>
 Dan Chaucer, the first warbler, whose sweet breath<br>
 Preluded those melodious bursts, that fill<br>
 The spacious times of great Elizabeth<br>
 With sounds that echo still.<br>
<br>
 And, for a while, the knowledge of his art<br>
 Held me above the subject, as strong gales<br>
 Hold swollen clouds from raining, tho' my heart,<br>
 Brimful of those wild tales,<br>
<br>
 Charged both mine eyes with tears.<br>
 In every land I saw, wherever light illumineth,<br>
 <a name="fktr"></a>Beauty and anguish walking hand in hand<br>
 The downward slope to death.  <a href="#fkt">2</a><br>
<br>
 Those far-renowned brides of ancient song<br>
 Peopled the hollow dark, like burning stars,<br>
 And I heard sounds of insult, shame, and wrong,<br>
 And trumpets blown for wars;<br>
<br>
 And clattering flints batter'd with clanging hoofs:<br>
 <a name="fkur"></a>And I saw crowds in column'd sanctuaries;<br>
 And forms that pass'd  <a href="#fku">3</a>  at windows and on
roofs<br>
 Of marble palaces;<br>
<br>
 Corpses across the threshold; heroes tall<br>
 <a name="fkvr"></a>Dislodging pinnacle and parapet<br>
 Upon the tortoise creeping to the wall;  <a href=
"#fkv">4</a><br>
 Lances in ambush set;<br>
<br>
 And high shrine-doors burst thro' with heated blasts<br>
 That run before the fluttering tongues of fire;<br>
 White surf wind-scatter'd over sails and masts,<br>
 And ever climbing higher;<br>
<br>
 Squadrons and squares of men in brazen plates,<br>
 Scaffolds, still sheets of water, divers woes,<br>
 Ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates,<br>
 And hush'd seraglios.<br>
<br>
 So shape chased shape as swift as, when to land<br>
 Bluster the winds and tides the self-same way,<br>
 Crisp foam-flakes scud along the level sand,<br>
 Torn from the fringe of spray.<br>
<br>
 I started once, or seem'd to start in pain,<br>
 Resolved on noble things, and strove to speak,<br>
 As when a great thought strikes along the brain,<br>
 And flushes all the cheek.<br>
<br>
 And once my arm was lifted to hew down,<br>
 A cavalier from off his saddle-bow,<br>
 That bore a lady from a leaguer'd town;<br>
 And then, I know not how,<br>
<br>
 All those sharp fancies, by down-lapsing thought<br>
 Stream'd onward, lost their edges, and did creep<br>
 Roll'd on each other, rounded, smooth'd and brought<br>
 Into the gulfs of sleep.<br>
<br>
 At last methought that I had wander'd far<br>
 In an old wood: fresh-wash'd in coolest dew,<br>
 <a name="fkwr"></a>The maiden splendours of the morning star<br>
 Shook in the steadfast  <a href="#fkw">5</a>  blue.<br>
<br>
 Enormous elmtree-boles did stoop and lean<br>
 Upon the dusky brushwood underneath<br>
 Their broad curved branches, fledged with clearest green,<br>
 New from its silken sheath.<br>
<br>
 The dim red morn had died, her journey done,<br>
 And with dead lips smiled at the twilight plain,<br>
 Half-fall'n across the threshold of the sun,<br>
 Never to rise again.<br>
<br>
 There was no motion in the dumb dead air,<br>
 Not any song of bird or sound of rill;<br>
 Gross darkness of the inner sepulchre<br>
 Is not so deadly still<br>
<br>
 As that wide forest.<br>
 <a name="fkxr"></a>Growths of jasmine turn'd<br>
 Their humid arms festooning tree to tree,  <a href=
"#fkx">6</a><br>
 And at the root thro' lush green grasses burn'd<br>
 The red anemone.<br>
<br>
 I knew the flowers, I knew the leaves, I knew<br>
 The tearful glimmer of the languid dawn<br>
 On those long, rank, dark wood-walks, drench'd in dew,<br>
 Leading from lawn to lawn.<br>
<br>
 The smell of violets, hidden in the green,<br>
 Pour'd back into my empty soul and frame<br>
 The times when I remember to have been<br>
 Joyful and free from blame.<br>
<br>
 And from within me a clear under-tone<br>
 Thrill'd thro' mine ears in that unblissful clime<br>
 "Pass freely thro': the wood is all thine own,<br>
 Until the end of time".<br>
<br>
 <a name="fkyr"></a>At length I saw a lady  <a href="#fky">7</a>
 within call,<br>
 <a name="fkzr"></a>Stiller than chisell'd marble, standing
there;<br>
 A daughter of the gods, divinely tall,  <a href="#fkz">8</a><br>
 And most divinely fair.<br>
<br>
 Her loveliness with shame and with surprise<br>
 Froze my swift speech: she turning on my face<br>
 The star-like sorrows of immortal eyes,<br>
 Spoke slowly in her place.<br>
<br>
 "I had great beauty: ask thou not my name:<br>
 No one can be more wise than destiny.<br>
 <a name="flar"></a>Many drew swords and died.<br>
 <a name="flbr"></a>Where'er I came I brought calamity."<br>
<br>
 "No marvel, sovereign lady  <a href="#fla">9</a> : in fair
field<br>
 Myself for such a face had boldly died,"  <a href=
"#flb">10</a><br>
 <a name="flcr"></a>I answer'd free; and turning I appeal'd<br>
 To one  <a href="#flc">11</a>  that stood beside.<br>
<br>
 But she, with sick and scornful looks averse,<br>
 To her full height her stately stature draws;<br>
 <a name="fldr"></a>"My youth," she said, "was blasted with a
curse:<br>
 <a name="fler"></a>This woman was the cause.<br>
<br>
 "I was cut off from hope in that sad place,  <a href=
"#fld">12</a><br>
 Which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears:  <a href=
"#fle">13</a><br>
 My father held his hand upon his face;<br>
 I, blinded with my tears,<br>
<br>
 "Still strove to speak: my voice was thick with sighs<br>
 As in a dream. Dimly I could descry<br>
 The stern black-bearded kings with wolfish eyes,<br>
 Waiting to see me die.<br>
<br>
 "The high masts flicker'd as they lay afloat;<br>
 The crowds, the temples, waver'd, and the shore;<br>
 <a name="flfr"></a>The bright death quiver'd at the victim's
throat;<br>
 Touch'd; and I knew no more."  <a href="#flf">14</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="flgr"></a>Whereto the other with a downward brow:<br>
 "I would the white cold heavy-plunging foam,  <a href=
"#flg">15</a><br>
 Whirl'd by the wind, had roll'd me deep below,<br>
 Then when I left my home."<br>
<br>
 Her slow full words sank thro' the silence drear,<br>
 As thunder-drops fall on a sleeping sea:<br>
 Sudden I heard a voice that cried, "Come here,<br>
 That I may look on thee".<br>
<br>
 I turning saw, throned on a flowery rise,<br>
 <a name="flhr"></a>One sitting on a crimson scarf unroll'd;<br>
 A queen, with swarthy cheeks  <a href="#flh">16</a>  and bold
black eyes,<br>
 Brow-bound with burning gold.<br>
<br>
 She, flashing forth a haughty smile, began:<br>
 "I govern'd men by change, and so I sway'd<br>
 All moods. Tis long since I have seen a man.<br>
 Once, like the moon, I made<br>
<br>
 "The ever-shifting currents of the blood<br>
 According to my humour ebb and flow.<br>
 I have no men to govern in this wood:<br>
 That makes my only woe.<br>
<br>
 "Nay &shy; yet it chafes me that I could not bend<br>
 One will; nor tame and tutor with mine eye<br>
 <a name="flir"></a>That dull cold-blooded Caesar. Prythee,
friend,<br>
 Where is Mark Antony?  <a href="#fli">17</a><br>
<br>
 "The man, my lover, with whom I rode sublime<br>
 <a name="fljr"></a>On Fortune's neck: we sat as God by God:<br>
 <a name="flkr"></a>The Nilus would have risen before his
time<br>
 And flooded at our nod.  <a href="#flj">18</a><br>
<br>
 "We drank the Libyan  <a href="#flk">19</a>  Sun to sleep, and
lit<br>
 <a name="fllr"></a>Lamps which outburn'd Canopus. O my life In
Egypt!<br>
 <a name="flmr"></a>O the dalliance and the wit,<br>
 The flattery and the strife,  <a href="#fll">20</a><br>
<br>
 "And the wild kiss, when fresh from war's alarms,  <a href=
"#flm">21</a><br>
 My Hercules, my Roman Antony,<br>
 My mail&egrave;d Bacchus leapt into my arms,<br>
 Contented there to die!<br>
<br>
 <a name="flnr"></a> "And there he died: and when I heard my
name<br>
 Sigh'd forth with life, I would not brook my fear  <a href=
"#fln">22</a><br>
 Of the other: with a worm I balk'd his fame.<br>
 What else was left? look here!"<br>
<br>
 (With that she tore her robe apart, and half<br>
 The polish'd argent of her breast to sight<br>
 Laid bare. Thereto she pointed with a laugh,<br>
 <a name="flor"></a>Showing the aspick's bite.)<br>
<br>
 "I died a Queen. The Roman soldier found  <a href=
"#flo">23</a><br>
 Me lying dead, my crown about my brows,<br>
 A name for ever! &shy; lying robed and crown'd,<br>
 Worthy a Roman spouse."<br>
<br>
 <a name="flpr"></a>Her warbling voice, a lyre of widest
range<br>
 Struck  <a href="#flp">24</a>  by all passion, did fall down and
glance<br>
 From tone to tone, and glided thro' all change<br>
 Of liveliest utterance.<br>
<br>
 When she made pause I knew not for delight;<br>
 Because with sudden motion from the ground<br>
 She raised her piercing orbs, and fill'd with light<br>
 The interval of sound.<br>
<br>
 Still with their fires Love tipt his keenest darts;<br>
 As once they drew into two burning rings<br>
 All beams of Love, melting the mighty hearts<br>
 Of captains and of kings.<br>
<br>
 Slowly my sense undazzled. Then I heard<br>
 A noise of some one coming thro' the lawn,<br>
 And singing clearer than the crested bird,<br>
 That claps his wings at dawn.<br>
<br>
 "The torrent brooks of hallow'd Israel<br>
 From craggy hollows pouring, late and soon,<br>
 Sound all night long, in falling thro' the dell,<br>
 Far-heard beneath the moon.<br>
<br>
 "The balmy moon of blessed Israel<br>
 Floods all the deep-blue gloom with beams divine:<br>
 All night the splinter'd crags that wall the dell<br>
 With spires of silver shine."<br>
<br>
 As one that museth where broad sunshine laves<br>
 The lawn by some cathedral, thro' the door<br>
 Hearing the holy organ rolling waves<br>
 Of sound on roof and floor,<br>
<br>
 Within, and anthem sung, is charm'd and tied<br>
 To where he stands, &shy; so stood I, when that flow<br>
 Of music left the lips of her that died<br>
 <a name="flqr"></a>To save her father's vow;<br>
<br>
 The daughter of the warrior Gileadite,  <a href=
"#flq">25</a><br>
 A maiden pure; as when she went along<br>
 From Mizpeh's tower'd gate with welcome light,<br>
 With timbrel and with song.<br>
<br>
 My words leapt forth: "Heaven heads the count of crimes<br>
 With that wild oath". She render'd answer high:<br>
 "Not so, nor once alone; a thousand times<br>
 I would be born and die.<br>
<br>
 "Single I grew, like some green plant, whose root<br>
 Creeps to the garden water-pipes beneath,<br>
 Feeding the flower; but ere my flower to fruit<br>
 Changed, I was ripe for death.<br>
<br>
 "My God, my land, my father &shy; these did move<br>
 Me from my bliss of life, that Nature gave,<br>
 Lower'd softly with a threefold cord of love<br>
 Down to a silent grave.<br>
<br>
 "And I went mourning, 'No fair Hebrew boy<br>
 Shall smile away my maiden blame among<br>
 The Hebrew mothers' &shy; emptied of all joy,<br>
 Leaving the dance and song,<br>
<br>
 "Leaving the olive-gardens far below,<br>
 Leaving the promise of my bridal bower,<br>
 The valleys of grape-loaded vines that glow<br>
 Beneath the battled tower<br>
<br>
 <a name="flrr1"></a>"The light white cloud swam over us.
Anon<br>
 We heard the lion roaring from his den;  <a href=
"#flr1">26</a><br>
 We saw the large white stars rise one by one,<br>
 Or, from the darken'd glen,<br>
<br>
 "Saw God divide the night with flying flame,<br>
 And thunder on the everlasting hills.<br>
 I heard Him, for He spake, and grief became<br>
 A solemn scorn of ills.<br>
<br>
 "When the next moon was roll'd into the sky,<br>
 Strength came to me that equall'd my desire.<br>
 How beautiful a thing it was to die<br>
 For God and for my sire!<br>
<br>
 "It comforts me in this one thought to dwell,<br>
 That I subdued me to my father's will;<br>
 Because the kiss he gave me, ere I fell,<br>
 Sweetens the spirit still.<br>
<br>
 <a name="flsr"></a>"Moreover it is written that my race<br>
 Hew'd Ammon, hip and thigh, from Aroer  <a href=
"#fls">27</a><br>
 On Arnon unto Minneth." Here her face<br>
 Glow'd, as I look'd at her.<br>
<br>
 She lock'd her lips: she left me where I stood:<br>
 "Glory to God," she sang, and past afar,<br>
 Thridding the sombre boskage of the wood,<br>
 Toward the morning-star.<br>
<br>
 Losing her carol I stood pensively,<br>
 As one that from a casement leans his head,<br>
 When midnight bells cease ringing suddenly,<br>
 And the old year is dead.<br>
<br>
 "Alas! alas!" a low voice, full of care,<br>
 Murmur'd beside me: "Turn and look on me:<br>
 I am that Rosamond, whom men call fair,<br>
 If what I was I be.<br>
<br>
 "Would I had been some maiden coarse and poor!<br>
 O me, that I should ever see the light!<br>
 Those dragon eyes of anger'd Eleanor<br>
 Do haunt me, day and night."<br>
<br>
 She ceased in tears, fallen from hope and trust:<br>
 To whom the Egyptian: "O, you tamely died!<br>
 You should have clung to Fulvia's waist, and thrust<br>
 The dagger thro' her side".<br>
<br>
 With that sharp sound the white dawn's creeping beams,<br>
 Stol'n to my brain, dissolved the mystery<br>
 Of folded sleep. The captain of my dreams<br>
 Ruled in the eastern sky.<br>
<br>
 Morn broaden'd on the borders of the dark,<br>
 <a name="fltr"></a>Ere I saw her, who clasp'd in her last
trance<br>
 Her murder'd father's head, or Joan of Arc,  <a href=
"#flt">28</a><br>
 A light of ancient France;<br>
<br>
 Or her, who knew that Love can vanquish Death,<br>
 <a name="flur"></a>Who kneeling, with one arm about her
king,<br>
 Drew forth the poison with her balmy breath,  <a href=
"#flu">29</a><br>
 Sweet as new buds in Spring.<br>
<br>
 No memory labours longer from the deep<br>
 Gold-mines of thought to lift the hidden ore<br>
 That glimpses, moving up, than I from sleep<br>
 To gather and tell o'er<br>
<br>
 Each little sound and sight. With what dull pain<br>
 Compass'd, how eagerly I sought to strike<br>
 Into that wondrous track of dreams again!<br>
 But no two dreams are like.<br>
<br>
 As when a soul laments, which hath been blest,<br>
 Desiring what is mingled with past years,<br>
 In yearnings that can never be exprest<br>
 <a name="flvr"></a>By sighs or groans or tears;<br>

the reading of the final edition, <i>i. e.</i>, "Which men called

<blockquote>"The tall masts quivered as they lay afloat,<br>
 The temples and the people and the shore,<br>

 Slowly, &shy; and nothing more".</blockquote>

It is curious that Tennyson should have allowed the last line to
stand so long; possibly it may have been to defy Lockhart's
sarcastic commentary: "What touching simplicity, what pathetic
resignation &shy; he cut my throat, nothing more!" With
Tennyson's picture should be compared &AElig;schylus,
<i>Agamem.</i>, 225-49, and Lucretius, i., 85-100. For the bold
and picturesque substitution of the effect for the cause in the
"bright death quiver'd" <i>cf.</i> Sophocles, <i>Electra</i>,
1395,

<blockquote><img src="TG30.gif" width="80" height="16" alt=

given us, in quintessence as it were, Shakespeare's superb
creation needs no commentary, but it is somewhat surprising to
find an accurate scholar like Tennyson guilty of the absurdity of
representing Cleopatra as of gipsy complexion. The daughter of
Ptolemy Aulates and a lady of Pontus, she was of Greek descent,
and had no taint at all of African intermixtures. See Peacock's

Another of Tennyson's delicious fancy portraits, the twin sister
to Adeline.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>1<br>
<br>
 O sweet pale Margaret,<br>
 O rare pale Margaret,<br>
 What lit your eyes with tearful power,<br>
 Like moonlight on a falling shower?<br>
 Who lent you, love, your mortal dower<br>
 Of pensive thought and aspect pale,<br>
 Your melancholy sweet and frail<br>
 As perfume of the cuckoo-flower?<br>
 From the westward-winding flood,<br>
 From the evening-lighted wood,<br>
 <a name="flwr"></a>From all things outward you have won<br>
 A tearful grace, as tho'  <a href="#flw">1</a>  you stood<br>
 Between the rainbow and the sun.<br>
 The very smile before you speak,<br>
 That dimples your transparent cheek,<br>
 Encircles all the heart, and feedeth<br>
 The senses with a still delight<br>
 Of dainty sorrow without sound,<br>
 Like the tender amber round,<br>
 Which the moon about her spreadeth,<br>
 Moving thro' a fleecy night.<br>
<br>
<br>
 2<br>
<br>
 You love, remaining peacefully,<br>
 To hear the murmur of the strife,<br>
 But enter not the toil of life.<br>
 Your spirit is the calmed sea,<br>
 Laid by the tumult of the fight.<br>
 You are the evening star, alway<br>
 Remaining betwixt dark and bright:<br>
 Lull'd echoes of laborious day<br>
 Come to you, gleams of mellow light<br>
 Float by you on the verge of night.<br>

 What can it matter, Margaret,<br>
 <a name="flxr"></a> What songs below the waning stars<br>

 <a name="flyr"></a>Exquisite Margaret, who can tell<br>
 The last wild thought of Chatelet,  <a href="#fly">3</a><br>
 Just ere the falling axe did part<br>

<br>
<br>
 4<br>
<br>
 A fairy shield your Genius made<br>
 And gave you on your natal day.<br>
 Your sorrow, only sorrow's shade,<br>
 Keeps real sorrow far away.<br>
 You move not in such solitudes,<br>
 You are not less divine,<br>
 But more human in your moods,<br>
 Than your twin-sister, Adeline.<br>
 Your hair is darker, and your eyes<br>
 Touch'd with a somewhat darker hue,<br>
 <a name="flzr"></a> And less aerially blue,<br>
 But ever trembling thro' the dew  <a href="#flz">4</a><br>
 Of dainty-woeful sympathies.<br>

<br>
 O sweet pale Margaret,<br>
 O rare pale Margaret,<br>
 Come down, come down, and hear me speak:<br>
 Tie up the ringlets on your cheek:<br>
 The sun is just about to set.<br>
 The arching lines are tall and shady,<br>
 And faint, rainy lights are seen,<br>
 Moving in the leavy beech.<br>
 Rise from the feast of sorrow, lady,<br>
 Where all day long you sit between<br>
 Joy and woe, and whisper each.<br>
 Or only look across the lawn,<br>
 Look out below your bower-eaves,<br>

<blockquote>Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,<br>
 And the winter winds are wearily sighing:<br>
 Toll ye the church-bell sad and slow,<br>
 And tread softly and speak low,<br>
 For the old year lies a-dying.<br>
 Old year, you must not die;<br>
 You came to us so readily,<br>
 You lived with us so steadily,<br>
 Old year, you shall not die.<br>
<br>
 He lieth still: he doth not move:<br>
 He will not see the dawn of day.<br>
 He hath no other life above.<br>
 He gave me a friend, and a true, true-love,<br>
 And the New-year will take 'em away.<br>
 Old year, you must not go;<br>
 So long as you have been with us,<br>
 Such joy as you have seen with us,<br>
 Old year, you shall not go.<br>
<br>
 He froth'd his bumpers to the brim;<br>
 A jollier year we shall not see.<br>
 But tho' his eyes are waxing dim,<br>
 And tho' his foes speak ill of him,<br>
 He was a friend to me.<br>
 Old year, you shall not die;<br>
 We did so laugh and cry with you,<br>
 I've half a mind to die with you,<br>
 Old year, if you must die.<br>

 He was full of joke and jest,<br>
 But all his merry quips are o'er.<br>
 To see him die, across the waste<br>
 His son and heir doth ride post-haste,<br>
 But he'll be dead before.<br>
 Every one for his own.<br>
 The night is starry and cold, my friend,<br>
 And the New-year blithe and bold, my friend,<br>
 Comes up to take his own.<br>
<br>
 How hard he breathes! over the snow<br>
 I heard just now the crowing cock.<br>
 The shadows flicker to and fro:<br>
 <a name="fmfr"></a>The cricket chirps: the light burns low:<br>
 'Tis nearly twelve  <a href="#fmf">1</a>  o'clock.<br>
 Shake hands, before you die.<br>
 Old year, we'll dearly rue for you:<br>
 What is it we can do for you?<br>
 Speak out before you die.<br>
<br>
 His face is growing sharp and thin.<br>
 Alack! our friend is gone.<br>
 Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:<br>
 Step from the corpse, and let him in<br>
 That standeth there alone,<br>
 And waiteth at the door.<br>
 There's a new foot on the floor, my friend,<br>
 And a new face at the door, my friend,<br>
 A new face at the door.</blockquote>

First published in 1833.<br>
<br>
This beautiful poem was addressed to James Spedding on the death
of his brother Edward.<br>


<blockquote><a name="fmgr"></a> The wind, that beats the
mountain, blows<br>
 More softly round the open wold,  <a href="#fmg">1</a><br>

 That are cast in gentle mould.<br>

<br>
 'Tis strange that those we lean on most,<br>
 Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,<br>
 Fall into shadow, soonest lost:<br>
 Those we love first are taken first.<br>
<br>
 God gives us love. Something to love<br>
 He lends us; but, when love is grown<br>
 To ripeness, that on which it throve<br>
 Falls off, and love is left alone.<br>
<br>
 This is the curse of time. Alas!<br>
 <a name="fmir"></a>In grief I am not all unlearn'd;<br>
 Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass;  <a href=

 One went, who never hath return'd.<br>
<br>
 He will not smile &shy; nor speak to me<br>
 Once more. Two years his chair is seen<br>
 Empty before us. That was he<br>
 Without whose life I had not been.<br>
<br>
 Your loss is rarer; for this star<br>
 Rose with you thro' a little arc<br>
 Of heaven, nor having wander'd far<br>
 Shot on the sudden into dark.<br>
<br>
 I knew your brother: his mute dust<br>
 <a name="fmjr"></a>I honour and his living worth:<br>
 A man more pure and bold  <a href="#fmj">4</a> and just<br>

 Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.<br>
 Great Nature is more wise than I:<br>
 I will not tell you not to weep.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fmkr"></a>And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,<br>
 Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain,  <a href="#fmk">5</a><br>
 I will not even preach to you,<br>
 "Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain".<br>
<br>
 Let Grief be her own mistress still.<br>
 She loveth her own anguish deep<br>
 More than much pleasure. Let her will<br>
 Be done &shy; to weep or not to weep.<br>
<br>
 I will not say "God's ordinance<br>
 Of Death is blown in every wind";<br>
 For that is not a common chance<br>
 That takes away a noble mind.<br>
<br>
 His memory long will live alone<br>
 <a name="fmlr"></a>In all our hearts, as mournful light<br>
 That broods above the fallen sun,  <a href="#fml">6</a><br>
 And dwells in heaven half the night.<br>
<br>
 Vain solace! Memory standing near<br>
 Cast down her eyes, and in her throat<br>
 <a name="fmmr"></a>Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear<br>
 Dropt on the letters  <a href="#fmm">7</a>  as I wrote.<br>
<br>
 I wrote I know not what. In truth,<br>
 How <i>should</i> I soothe you anyway,<br>
 Who miss the brother of your youth?<br>
 Yet something I did wish to say:<br>
<br>
 For he too was a friend to me:<br>
 Both are my friends, and my true breast<br>
 <a name="fmnr"></a>Bleedeth for both; yet it may be<br>
 That only  <a href="#fmn">8</a>  silence suiteth best.<br>
<br>
 Words weaker than your grief would make<br>
 <a name="fmor"></a>Grief more. 'Twere better I should cease;<br>
 Although myself could almost take  <a href="#fmo">9</a><br>
 The place of him that sleeps in peace.<br>
<br>
 Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace:<br>
 Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,<br>
 While the stars burn, the moons increase,<br>
 And the great ages onward roll.<br>
<br>
 Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet.<br>
 Nothing comes to thee new or strange.<br>
 Sleep full of rest from head to feet;<br>
 Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section55">You ask me, why, tho' ill at
ease"</a></h3>

<br>
This is another poem which, though included among those belonging
to 1833, was not published till 1842. It is an interesting
illustration, like the next poem but one, of Tennyson's political
opinions; he was, he said, "of the same politics as Shakespeare,
Bacon and every sane man". He was either ignorant of the politics
of Shakespeare and Bacon or did himself great injustice by the
remark. It would have been more true to say &shy; for all his
works illustrate it &shy; that he was of the same politics as
Burke. He is here, and in all his poems, a Liberal-Conservative
in the proper sense of the term. At the time this trio of poems
was written England was passing through the throes which
preceded, accompanied and followed the Reform Bill, and the
lessons which Tennyson preaches in them were particularly
appropriate. He belonged to the Liberal Party rather in relation
to social and religious than to political questions. Thus he
ardently supported the Anti-slavery Convention and advocated the
measure for abolishing subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles,
but he was, as a politician, on the side of Canning, Peel and the
Duke of Wellington, regarding as they did the new-born democracy
with mingled feelings of apprehension and perplexity. His exact
attitude is indicated by some verses written about this time
published by his son (<i>Life</i>, i., 69-70). If Mr. Aubrey de
Vere is correct this and the following poem were occasioned by
some popular demonstrations connected with the Reform Bill and
its rejection by the House of Lords. See <i>Life of Tennyson</i>,
vol. i., appendix.<br>

<br>
First published in 1842, but it seems to have been written in
1834. The fourth and fifth stanzas are given in a postscript of a
letter from Tennyson to James Spedding, dated 1834.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>Of old sat Freedom on the heights,<br>

<h3><a name="section57">"Love thou thy land, with love
far-brought"</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842.<br>
<br>
This poem had been written by 1834, for Tennyson sends it in a
letter dated that year to James Spedding (see <i>Life,</i>, i.,
173).<br>


<blockquote>Love thou thy land, with love far-brought<br>
 From out the storied Past, and used<br>
 Within the Present, but transfused<br>
 Thro' future time by power of thought.<br>
<br>
 True love turn'd round on fixed poles,<br>
 Love, that endures not sordid ends,<br>
 For English natures, freemen, friends,<br>
 Thy brothers and immortal souls.<br>
<br>
 But pamper not a hasty time,<br>
 Nor feed with crude imaginings<br>
 The herd, wild hearts and feeble wings,<br>
 That every sophister can lime.<br>
<br>
 Deliver not the tasks of might<br>

 Tho'  <a href="#fmv">1</a>  sitting girt with doubtful

 Bear seed of men and growth  <a href="#fmx">3</a>  of minds.<br>
<br>
 Watch what main-currents draw the years:<br>
 Cut Prejudice against the grain:<br>
 But gentle words are always gain:<br>
 Regard the weakness of thy peers:<br>
<br>
 Nor toil for title, place, or touch<br>
 Of pension, neither count on praise:<br>
 It grows to guerdon after-days:<br>
 Nor deal in watch-words overmuch;<br>
<br>
 Not clinging to some ancient saw;<br>
 Not master'd by some modern term;<br>
 Not swift nor slow to change, but firm:<br>
 And in its season bring the law;<br>
<br>
 That from Discussion's lip may fall<br>
 With Life, that, working strongly, binds &shy;<br>
 Set in all lights by many minds,<br>

 Our being, lest we rust in ease.<br>
 We all are changed by still degrees,<br>
 All but the basis of the soul.<br>
<br>
 So let the change which comes be free<br>
 To ingroove itself with that, which flies,<br>
 And work, a joint of state, that plies<br>
 Its office, moved with sympathy.<br>
<br>
 A saying, hard to shape an act;<br>
 For all the past of Time reveals<br>
 A bridal dawn of thunder-peals,<br>
 Wherever Thought hath wedded Fact.<br>

 Ev'n now we hear with inward strife<br>
 A motion toiling in the gloom &shy;<br>
 The Spirit of the years to come<br>
 Yearning to mix himself with Life.<br>

 Completion in a painful school;<br>
 Phantoms of other forms of rule,<br>

<h3><a name="section58">The Goose</a></h3>

<br>
This was first published in 1842. No alteration has since been
made in it.<br>
<br>
This poem, which was written at the time of the Reform Bill
agitation, is a political allegory showing how illusory were the
supposed advantages held out by the Radicals to the poor and
labouring classes. The old woman typifies these classes, the
stranger the Radicals, the goose the Radical programme, Free
Trade and the like, the eggs such advantages as the proposed
Radical measures might for a time seem to confer, the cluttering
goose, the storm and whirlwind the heavy price which would have
to be paid for them in the social anarchy resulting from
triumphant Radicalism. The allegory may be narrowed to the Free
Trade question.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>I knew an old wife lean and poor,<br>
 Her rags scarce held together;<br>
 There strode a stranger to the door,<br>
 And it was windy weather.<br>
<br>
 He held a goose upon his arm,<br>
 He utter'd rhyme and reason,<br>
 "Here, take the goose, and keep you warm,<br>
 It is a stormy season".<br>
<br>
 She caught the white goose by the leg,<br>
 A goose &shy; 'twas no great matter.<br>
 The goose let fall a golden egg<br>
 With cackle and with clatter.<br>
<br>
 She dropt the goose, and caught the pelf,<br>
 And ran to tell her neighbours;<br>
 And bless'd herself, and cursed herself,<br>
 And rested from her labours.<br>
<br>
 And feeding high, and living soft,<br>
 Grew plump and able-bodied;<br>
 Until the grave churchwarden doff'd,<br>
 The parson smirk'd and nodded.<br>
<br>
 So sitting, served by man and maid,<br>
 She felt her heart grow prouder:<br>
 But, ah! the more the white goose laid<br>
 It clack'd and cackled louder.<br>
<br>
 It clutter'd here, it chuckled there;<br>
 It stirr'd the old wife's mettle:<br>
 She shifted in her elbow-chair,<br>
 And hurl'd the pan and kettle.<br>
<br>
 "A quinsy choke thy cursed note!"<br>
 Then wax'd her anger stronger:<br>
 "Go, take the goose, and wring her throat,<br>
 I will not bear it longer".<br>
<br>
 Then yelp'd the cur, and yawl'd the cat;<br>
 Ran Gaffer, stumbled Gammer.<br>
 The goose flew this way and flew that,<br>
 And fill'd the house with clamour.<br>
<br>
 As head and heels upon the floor<br>
 They flounder'd all together,<br>
 There strode a stranger to the door,<br>
 And it was windy weather:<br>
<br>
 He took the goose upon his arm,<br>
 He utter'd words of scorning;<br>
 "So keep you cold, or keep you warm,<br>
 It is a stormy morning".<br>
<br>
 The wild wind rang from park and plain,<br>
 And round the attics rumbled,<br>
 Till all the tables danced again,<br>
 And half the chimneys tumbled.<br>
<br>
 The glass blew in, the fire blew out,<br>
 The blast was hard and harder.<br>
 Her cap blew off, her gown blew up,<br>
 And a whirlwind clear'd the larder;<br>
<br>
 And while on all sides breaking loose<br>
 Her household fled the danger,<br>
 Quoth she, "The Devil take the goose,<br>
 And God forget the stranger!"</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section59">The Epic</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842; "tho'" for "though" in line 44 has been
the only alteration made since 1850.<br>
<br>
This Prologue was written, like the Epilogue, after "The Epic"
had been composed, being added, Fitzgerald says, to anticipate or
excuse "the faint Homeric echoes," to give a reason for telling
an old-world tale. The poet "mouthing out his hollow oes and aes"
is, we are told, a good description of Tennyson's tone and manner
of reading.<br>


<blockquote>At Francis Allen's on the Christmas-eve, &shy;<br>
 The game of forfeits done &shy; the girls all kiss'd<br>
 Beneath the sacred bush and past away &shy;<br>
 The parson Holmes, the poet Everard Hall,<br>
 The host, and I sat round the wassail-bowl,<br>
 Then half-way ebb'd: and there we held a talk,<br>
 How all the old honour had from Christmas gone,<br>
 Or gone, or dwindled down to some odd games<br>
 In some odd nooks like this; till I, tired out<br>
 With cutting eights that day upon the pond,<br>
 Where, three times slipping from the outer edge,<br>
 I bump'd the ice into three several stars,<br>
 Fell in a doze; and half-awake I heard<br>
 <a name="fnbr"></a>The parson taking wide and wider sweeps,<br>
 Now harping on the church-commissioners,  <a href=
"#fnb">1</a><br>
 Now hawking at Geology and schism;<br>
 Until I woke, and found him settled down<br>
 Upon the general decay of faith<br>
 Right thro' the world, "at home was little left,<br>
 And none abroad: there was no anchor, none,<br>
 To hold by". Francis, laughing, clapt his hand<br>
 On Everard's shoulder, with "I hold by him".<br>
 "And I," quoth Everard, "by the wassail-bowl."<br>
 "Why, yes," I said, "we knew your gift that way<br>
 At college: but another which you had,<br>
 I mean of verse (for so we held it then),<br>
 <a name="fncr"></a>What came of that?" "You know," said Frank,
"he burnt<br>
 His epic, his King Arthur, some twelve books " &shy;  <a href=
"#fnc">2</a><br>
 And then to me demanding why? "Oh, sir,<br>
 He thought that nothing new was said, or else<br>
 Something so said 'twas nothing &shy; that a truth<br>
 Looks freshest in the fashion of the day:<br>
 God knows: he has a mint of reasons: ask.<br>
 It pleased <i>me</i> well enough." "Nay, nay," said Hall,<br>
 "Why take the style of those heroic times?<br>
 For nature brings not back the Mastodon,<br>
 <a name="fndr"></a>Nor we those times; and why should any
man<br>
 Remodel models? these twelve books of mine  <a href=
"#fnd">3</a><br>
 Were faint Homeric echoes, nothing-worth,<br>
 Mere chaff and draff, much better burnt."<br>
 "But I," Said Francis, "pick'd the eleventh from this
hearth,<br>
 And have it: keep a thing its use will come.<br>
 I hoard it as a sugar-plum for Holmes."<br>
 He laugh'd, and I, though sleepy, like a horse<br>
 That hears the corn-bin open, prick'd my ears;<br>
 For I remember'd Everard's college fame<br>
 When we were Freshmen: then at my request<br>
 He brought it; and the poet little urged,<br>
 But with some prelude of disparagement,<br>
 Read, mouthing out his hollow oes and aes,<br>
 Deep-chested music, and to this result.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section60">Morte d'Arthur</a></h3>

<br>
This is Tennyson's first study from Malory's <i>Morte
d'Arthur</i>. We learn from Fitzgerald that it was written as
early as the spring of 1835, for in that year Tennyson read it to
Fitzgerald and Spedding, "out of a MS. in a little red book," and
again we learn that he repeated some lines of it at the end of
May, 1835, one calm day on Windermere, adding "Not bad that,
Fitz., is it?" (<i>Life</i>, i., 184). It is here represented as
the eleventh book of an Epic, the rest of which had been
destroyed, though Tennyson afterwards incorporated it, adding
introductory lines, with what was virtually to prove an Epic in
twelve books, <i>The Idylls of the King</i>. The substance of the
poem is drawn from the third, fourth and fifth chapters of the
twenty-first book of Malory's <i>Romance</i>, which is followed
very closely. It is called "an Homeric echo," but the diction
bears a much closer resemblance to that of Virgil than to that of
Homer, though the rhythm is perhaps more Homeric than Virgilian.
It is Tennyson's masterpiece in "the grand style," and is indeed
as near perfection as any work of this kind could be. In spite of
its singular mixture of simplicity, purely Homeric, and
artificiality, at times ultra-Virgilian, the incongruity never
shocks, so noble and impressive is the general effect. The text
of 1842 was never subsequently altered except in the spelling of
"mere" and "though" in lines 37, 77, 147, 155, 162, 272, and in
the insertion in 1853 of the line: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>"Across the ridge and pac'd beside the
mere."</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>So all day long the noise of battle roll'd<br>
 Among the mountains by the winter sea;<br>
 Until King Arthur's table, man by man,<br>
 Had fall'n in Lyonness about their Lord,<br>
 King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,<br>
 The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,<br>
 <a name="fner"></a>Sir Bedivere, the last of all his
knights,<br>
 And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,  <a href=
"#fne">1</a><br>
 A broken chancel with a broken cross,<br>
 That stood on a dark strait of barren land.<br>
 On one side lay the Ocean, and on one<br>
 Lay a great water, and the moon was full.<br>
 Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br>
 "The sequel of to-day unsolders all<br>
 The goodliest fellowship of famous knights<br>
 Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep<br>
 They sleep &shy; the men I loved. I think that we<br>
 Shall never more, at any future time,<br>
 Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,<br>
 Walking about the gardens and the halls<br>
 Of Camelot, as in the days that were.<br>
 I perish by this people which I made, &shy;<br>
 Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again<br>
 To rule once more &shy; but let what will be, be,<br>
 I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm<br>
 <a name="fnfr"></a>That without help I cannot last till
morn.<br>
 Thou therefore take my brand  <a href="#fnf">2</a> 
Excalibur,<br>
 Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how<br>
 In those old days, one summer noon, an arm<br>
 Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,<br>
 Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br>
 Holding the sword &shy; and how I row'd across<br>
 And took it, and have worn it, like a king:<br>
 And, wheresoever I am sung or told<br>
 In aftertime, this also shall be known:<br>
 But now delay not: take Excalibur,<br>
 And fling him far into the middle mere:<br>
 Watch what thou se&euml;st, and lightly bring me word."<br>
 To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>
 "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,<br>
 Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm.<br>
 A little thing may harm a wounded man.<br>
 Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,<br>
 Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."<br>
 So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept<br>
 And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,<br>
 Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,<br>
 Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang<br>
 Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down<br>
 By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,<br>
 Came on the shining levels of the lake.<br>
 There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,<br>
 And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,<br>
 Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth<br>
 <a name="fngr"></a>And sparkled keen with frost against the
hilt:<br>
 For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,  <a href=
"#fng">3</a><br>
 Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work<br>
 Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long<br>
 <a name="fnhr"></a>That both his eyes were dazzled, as he
stood,<br>
 This way and that dividing the swift mind,  <a href=
"#fnh">4</a><br>
 In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd<br>
 Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd<br>
 There in the many-knotted waterflags,<br>
 That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.<br>
 So strode he back slow to the wounded king.<br>
 Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br>
 "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?<br>
 What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br>
 <a name="fnir"></a>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>
 "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,  <a href=
"#fni">5</a><br>
 And the wild water lapping on the crag."<br>
 To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:<br>
 "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,<br>
 Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd<br>
 Thy f&euml;alty, nor like a noble knight:<br>
 For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,<br>
 Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.<br>
 <a name="fnjr"></a>This is a shameful thing for men to lie.<br>
 Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again  <a href=
"#fnj">6</a><br>
 As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing<br>
 I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."<br>
 <a name="fnkr"></a>Then went Sir Bedivere the second time<br>
 Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,  <a href=
"#fnk">7</a><br>
 Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;<br>
 But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,<br>
 How curiously and strangely chased, he smote<br>
 His palms together, and he cried aloud,<br>
 "And if indeed I cast the brand away,<br>
 Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,<br>
 Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,<br>
 Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.<br>
 What good should follow this, if this were done?<br>
 What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,<br>
 Seeing obedience is the bond of rule,<br>
 Were it well to obey then, if a king demand<br>
 An act unprofitable against himself?<br>
 The king is sick, and knows not what he does.<br>
 What record, or what relic of my lord<br>
 Should be to aftertime, but empty breath<br>
 And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,<br>
 Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,<br>
 Some one might show it at a joust of arms,<br>
 Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,<br>
 Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.<br>
 Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps<br>
 Upon the hidden bases of the hills."<br>
 So might some old man speak in the aftertime<br>
 To all the people, winning reverence.<br>
 But now much honour and much fame were lost."<br>
 So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,<br>
 And hid Excalibur the second time,<br>
 And so strode back slow to the wounded King.<br>
 Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:<br>
 "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br>
 And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>
 "I heard the water lapping on the crag,<br>
 And the long ripple washing in the reeds."<br>
 <a name="fnlr"></a>To whom replied King Arthur, much in
wrath:<br>
 "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,  <a href="#fnl">8</a><br>
 <a name="fnmr"></a>Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!<br>
 Authority forgets a dying king,  <a href="#fnm">9</a><br>
 Laid widow'd of the power in his eye<br>
 That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,<br>
 For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,<br>
 In whom should meet the offices of all,<br>
 Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;<br>
 Either from lust of gold, or like a girl<br>
 Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.<br>
 Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,<br>
 And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:<br>
 But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,<br>
 <a name="fnnr"></a>I will arise and slay thee with my
hands."<br>
 Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,  <a href=
"#fnn">10</a><br>
 And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged<br>
 Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,<br>
 And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand<br>
 Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,<br>
 And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,<br>
 Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,<br>
 Seen where the moving isles of winter shock<br>
 By night, with noises of the northern sea.<br>
 So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:<br>
 But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm<br>
 Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br>
 And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him<br>
 Three times, and drew him under in the mere.<br>
 And lightly went the other to the King.<br>
 Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:<br>
 'Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.<br>
 Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"<br>
 And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>
 "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems<br>
 Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,<br>
 Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,<br>
 Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,<br>
 So great a miracle as yonder hilt.<br>
 Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;<br>
 But when I look'd again, behold an arm,<br>
 Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br>
 That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him<br>
 Three times, and drew him under in the mere."<br>
 And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:<br>
 "My end draws nigh;'tis time that I were gone.<br>
 <a name="fnor"></a>Make broad thy shoulders to receive my
weight,<br>
 And bear me to the margin; yet I fear  <a href="#fno">11</a><br>
 My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."<br>
 So saying, from the pavement he hath rose,<br>
 Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,<br>
 And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes<br>
 As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere<br>
 Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,<br>
 And would have spoken, but he found not words,<br>
 Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,<br>
 O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,<br>
 And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.<br>
 But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,<br>
 Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed<br>
 When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,<br>
 Muttering and murmuring at his ear"<br>
 Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die ".<br>
 But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,<br>
 Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,<br>
 Larger than human on the frozen hills.<br>
 He heard the deep behind him, and a cry<br>
 Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.<br>
 Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves<br>
 And barren chasms, and all to left and right<br>
 The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based<br>
 His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang<br>
 Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels &shy;<br>
 And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,<br>
 <a name="fnpr"></a>And the long glories of the winter moon.<br>
 Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,  <a href=
"#fnp">12</a><br>
 Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,<br>
 Beneath them; and descending they were ware<br>
 That all the decks were dense with stately forms<br>
 Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream &shy; by these<br>
 Three Queens with crowns of gold &shy; and from them rose<br>
 A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,<br>
 And, as it were one voice, an agony<br>
 Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills<br>
 All night in a waste land, where no one comes,<br>
 Or hath come, since the making of the world.<br>
 Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge,"<br>
 And to the barge they came. There those three Queens<br>
 Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.<br>
 But she, that rose the tallest of them all<br>
 And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,<br>
 And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,<br>
 And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,<br>
 And dropping bitter tears against his brow<br>
 Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white<br>
 And colourless, and like the wither'd moon<br>
 Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;<br>
 And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops<br>
 Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls &shy;<br>
 That made his forehead like a rising sun<br>
 High from the d&auml;is-throne &shy; were parch'd with dust;<br>
 Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,<br>
 Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.<br>
 So like a shatter'd column lay the King;<br>
 Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,<br>
 From spur to plume a star of tournament,<br>
 Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged<br>
 <a name="fnqr"></a>Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.<br>
 Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,  <a href=
"#fnq">13</a><br>
 "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?<br>
 Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?<br>
 For now I see the true old times are dead,<br>
 When every morning brought a noble chance,<br>
 And every chance brought out a noble knight.<br>
 Such times have been not since the light that led<br>
 The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.<br>
 But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved<br>
 Which was an image of the mighty world;<br>
 And I, the last, go forth companionless.<br>
 And the days darken round me, and the years,<br>
 Among new men, strange faces, other minds."<br>
 And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:<br>
 <a name="fnrr1"></a>"The old order changeth, yielding place to
new,<br>
 And God fulfils Himself in many ways,  <a href=
"#fnr1">14</a><br>
 Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.<br>
 Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?<br>
 I have lived my life, and that which I have done<br>
 May He within Himself make pure! but thou,<br>
 If thou shouldst never see my face again,<br>
 Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer<br>
 Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice<br>
 Rise like a fountain for me night and day.<br>
 For what are men better than sheep or goats<br>
 That nourish a blind life within the brain,<br>
 If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer<br>
 Both for themselves and those who call them friend?<br>
 <a name="fnsr"></a>For so the whole round earth is every way<br>
 Bound by gold chains  <a href="#fns">15</a>  about the feet of
God.<br>
 But now farewell. I am going a long way<br>
 With these thou se&euml;st &shy; if indeed I go &shy;<br>
 (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)<br>
 <a name="fntr"></a>To the island-valley of Avilion;<br>
 Where falls not hail, or rain,  <a href="#fnt">16</a>  or any
snow,<br>
 Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies<br>
 <a name="fnur"></a>Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with
orchard-lawns<br>
 And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,  <a href=
"#fnu">17</a><br>
 Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."<br>
 So said he, and the barge with oar and sail<br>
 Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan<br>
 That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,<br>
 Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood<br>
 With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere<br>
 Revolving many memories, till the hull<br>
 Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn.<br>
 And on the mere the wailing died away.<br>
<br>
 Here ended Hall, and our last light, that long<br>
 Had wink'd and threaten'd darkness, flared and fell:<br>
 At which the Parson, sent to sleep with sound,<br>
 And waked with silence, grunted "Good!" but we<br>
 Sat rapt: It was the tone with which he read &shy;<br>
 Perhaps some modern touches here and there<br>
 Redeem'd it from the charge of nothingness &shy;<br>
 Or else we loved the man, and prized his work;<br>
 I know not: but we sitting, as I said,<br>
 The cock crew loud; as at that time of year<br>
 The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn:<br>
 Then Francis, muttering, like a man ill-used,<br>
 "There now &shy; that's nothing!" drew a little back,<br>
 And drove his heel into the smoulder'd log,<br>
 That sent a blast of sparkles up the flue;<br>
 And so to bed; where yet in sleep I seem'd<br>
 To sail with Arthur under looming shores.<br>
 Point after point; till on to dawn, when dreams<br>
 Begin to feel the truth and stir of day,<br>
 To me, methought, who waited with a crowd,<br>
 There came a bark that, blowing forward, bore,<br>
 King Arthur, like a modern gentleman<br>
 Of stateliest port; and all the people cried,<br>
 "Arthur is come again: he cannot die".<br>
 Then those that stood upon the hills behind<br>
 Repeated &shy; "Come again, and thrice as fair";<br>
 And, further inland, voices echoed &shy;<br>
 "Come With all good things, and war shall be no more".<br>
 At this a hundred bells began to peal,<br>
 That with the sound I woke, and heard indeed<br>
 The clear church-bells ring in the Christmas morn.</blockquote>

 So Sir Bedivere departed and by the way he beheld that noble

<h3><a name="section61">The Gardener's Daughter</a></h3>

<br>
<b>or, The Pictures.</b><br>
<br>
In the <i>Gardener's Daughter</i> we have the first of that
delightful series of poems dealing with scenes and characters
from ordinary English life, and named appropriately <i>English
Idylls</i>. The originator of this species of poetry in England
was Southey, in his <i>English Eclogues</i>, written before 1799.
In the preface to these eclogues, which are in blank verse,
Southey says: "The following eclogues, I believe, bear no
resemblance to any poems in our language. This species of
composition has become popular in Germany, and I was induced to
attempt it by an account of the German idylls given me in
conversation." Southey's eclogues are eight in number: <i>The Old
Mansion House</i>, <i>The Grandmother's Tale</i>, <i>Hannah</i>,
<i>The Sailor's Mother</i>, <i>The Witch</i>, <i>The Ruined
Cottage</i>, <i>The Last of the Family</i> and <i>The Alderman's
Funeral</i>. Southey was followed by Wordsworth in <i>The
Brothers</i> and <i>Michael</i>. Southey has nothing of the
charm, grace and classical finish of his disciple, but how nearly
Tennyson follows him, as copy and model, may be seen by anyone
who compares Tennyson's studies with <i>The Ruined Cottage</i>.
But Tennyson's real master was Theocritus, whose influence
pervades these poems not so much directly in definite imitation
as indirectly in colour and tone.<br>
<br>
<i>The Gardener's Daughter</i> was written as early as 1835, as
it was read to Fitzgerald in that year (<i>Life of Tennyson</i>,
i., 182). Tennyson originally intended to insert a prologue to be
entitled <i>The Antechamber</i>, which contained an elaborate
picture of himself, but he afterwards suppressed it. It is given
in the <i>Life</i>, i., 233-4. This poem stands alone among the
Idylls in being somewhat overloaded with ornament. The text of
1842 remained unaltered through all the subsequent editions
except in line 235. After 1851 the form "tho'" is substituted for
"though".<br>
<br>


<blockquote>This morning is the morning of the day,<br>
 When I and Eustace from the city went<br>
 To see the Gardener's Daughter; I and he,<br>
 Brothers in Art; a friendship so complete<br>
 Portion'd in halves between us, that we grew<br>
 The fable of the city where we dwelt.<br>
 My Eustace might have sat for Hercules;<br>
 So muscular he spread, so broad of breast.<br>
 He, by some law that holds in love, and draws<br>
 The greater to the lesser, long desired<br>
 A certain miracle of symmetry,<br>
 <a name="fnvr"></a>A miniature of loveliness, all grace<br>
 Summ'd up and closed in little; &shy; Juliet, she  <a href=
"#fnv">1</a><br>
 So light of foot, so light of spirit &shy; oh, she<br>
 To me myself, for some three careless moons,<br>
 The summer pilot of an empty heart<br>
 Unto the shores of nothing! Know you not<br>
 Such touches are but embassies of love,<br>
 To tamper with the feelings, ere he found<br>
 Empire for life? but Eustace painted her,<br>
 And said to me, she sitting with us then,<br>
 "When will <i>you</i> paint like this?" and I replied,<br>
 (My words were half in earnest, half in jest),<br>
 "'Tis not your work, but Love's. Love, unperceived,<br>
 A more ideal Artist he than all,<br>
 Came, drew your pencil from you, made those eyes<br>
 Darker than darkest pansies, and that hair<br>
 More black than ashbuds in the front of March."<br>
 And Juliet answer'd laughing, "Go and see<br>
 The Gardener's daughter: trust me, after that,<br>
 You scarce can fail to match his masterpiece ".<br>
 And up we rose, and on the spur we went.<br>
 Not wholly in the busy world, nor quite<br>
 Beyond it, blooms the garden that I love.<br>
 News from the humming city comes to it<br>
 In sound of funeral or of marriage bells;<br>
 And, sitting muffled in dark leaves, you hear<br>
 The windy clanging of the minster clock;<br>
 Although between it and the garden lies<br>
 A league of grass, wash'd by a slow broad stream,<br>
 That, stirr'd with languid pulses of the oar,<br>
 Waves all its lazy lilies, and creeps on,<br>
 Barge-laden, to three arches of a bridge<br>
 Crown'd with the minster-towers.<br>
<br>
 The fields between<br>
 Are dewy-fresh, browsed by deep-udder'd kine,<br>
 <a name="fnwr"></a>And all about the large lime feathers
low,<br>
 The lime a summer home of murmurous wings.  <a href=
"#fnw">2</a><br>
 In that still place she, hoarded in herself,<br>
 Grew, seldom seen: not less among us lived<br>
 Her fame from lip to lip. Who had not heard<br>
 Of Rose, the Gardener's daughter? Where was he,<br>
 So blunt in memory, so old at heart,<br>
 At such a distance from his youth in grief,<br>
 That, having seen, forgot? The common mouth,<br>
 So gross to express delight, in praise of her<br>
 Grew oratory. Such a lord is Love,<br>
 And Beauty such a mistress of the world.<br>
 And if I said that Fancy, led by Love,<br>
 Would play with flying forms and images,<br>
 Yet this is also true, that, long before<br>
 I look'd upon her, when I heard her name<br>
 My heart was like a prophet to my heart,<br>
 And told me I should love. A crowd of hopes,<br>
 That sought to sow themselves like winged seeds,<br>
 Born out of everything I heard and saw,<br>
 Flutter'd about my senses and my soul;<br>
 And vague desires, like fitful blasts of balm<br>
 To one that travels quickly, made the air<br>
 Of Life delicious, and all kinds of thought,<br>
 That verged upon them sweeter than the dream<br>
 Dream'd by a happy man, when the dark East,<br>
 Unseen, is brightening to his bridal morn.<br>
 And sure this orbit of the memory folds<br>
 For ever in itself the day we went<br>
 To see her. All the land in flowery squares,<br>
 <a name="fnXr"></a>Beneath a broad and equal-blowing wind,<br>
 Smelt of the coming summer, as one large cloud  <a href=
"#fnx">3</a><br>
 Drew downward: but all else of heaven was pure<br>
 Up to the Sun, and May from verge to verge,<br>
 And May with me from head to heel. And now,<br>
 As tho' 'twere yesterday, as tho' it were<br>
 The hour just flown, that morn with all its sound<br>
 (For those old Mays had thrice the life of these),<br>
 Rings in mine ears. The steer forgot to graze,<br>
 And, where the hedge-row cuts the pathway, stood,<br>
 Leaning his horns into the neighbour field,<br>
 And lowing to his fellows. From the woods<br>
 Came voices of the well-contented doves.<br>
 The lark could scarce get out his notes for joy,<br>
 But shook his song together as he near'd<br>
 His happy home, the ground. To left and right,<br>
 <a name="fnyr"></a>The cuckoo told his name to all the
hills;<br>
 <a name="fnzr"></a>The mellow ouzel fluted in the elm;<br>
 The redcap  <a href="#fny">4</a>  whistled;  <a href=
"#fnz">5</a>  and the nightingale<br>
 Sang loud, as tho' he were the bird of day.<br>
 And Eustace turn'd, and smiling said to me,<br>
 "Hear how the bushes echo! by my life,<br>
 These birds have joyful thoughts. Think you they sing<br>
 Like poets, from the vanity of song?<br>
 Or have they any sense of why they sing?<br>
 And would they praise the heavens for what they have?"<br>
 And I made answer, "Were there nothing else<br>
 For which to praise the heavens but only love,<br>
 That only love were cause enough for praise".<br>
 Lightly he laugh'd, as one that read my thought,<br>
 And on we went; but ere an hour had pass'd,<br>
 We reach'd a meadow slanting to the North;<br>
 Down which a well-worn pathway courted us<br>
 To one green wicket in a privet hedge;<br>
 This, yielding, gave into a grassy walk<br>
 Thro' crowded lilac-ambush trimly pruned;<br>
 And one warm gust, full-fed with perfume, blew<br>
 Beyond us, as we enter'd in the cool.<br>
 The garden stretches southward. In the midst<br>
 A cedar spread his dark-green layers of shade.<br>
 The garden-glasses shone, and momently<br>
 The twinkling laurel scatter'd silver lights.<br>
 "Eustace," I said, "This wonder keeps the house."<br>
 He nodded, but a moment afterwards<br>
 He cried, "Look! look!" Before he ceased I turn'd,<br>
 And, ere a star can wink, beheld her there.<br>
 For up the porch there grew an Eastern rose,<br>
 That, flowering high, the last night's gale had caught,<br>
 And blown across the walk. One arm aloft &shy;<br>
 Gown'd in pure white, that fitted to the shape &shy;<br>
 Holding the bush, to fix it back, she stood.<br>
 A single stream of all her soft brown hair<br>
 Pour'd on one side: the shadow of the flowers<br>
 Stole all the golden gloss, and, wavering<br>
 Lovingly lower, trembled on her waist &shy;<br>
 Ah, happy shade &shy; and still went wavering down,<br>
 But, ere it touch'd a foot, that might have danced<br>
 The greensward into greener circles, dipt,<br>
 And mix'd with shadows of the common ground!<br>
 But the full day dwelt on her brows, and sunn'd<br>
 Her violet eyes, and all her Hebe-bloom,<br>
 And doubled his own warmth against her lips,<br>
 And on the bounteous wave of such a breast<br>
 As never pencil drew. Half light, half shade,<br>
 She stood, a sight to make an old man young.<br>
 So rapt, we near'd the house; but she, a Rose<br>
 In roses, mingled with her fragrant toil,<br>
 Nor heard us come, nor from her tendance turn'd<br>
 Into the world without; till close at hand,<br>
 And almost ere I knew mine own intent,<br>
 This murmur broke the stillness of that air<br>
 Which brooded round about her: "Ah, one rose,<br>
 One rose, but one, by those fair fingers cull'd,<br>
 Were worth a hundred kisses press'd on lips<br>
 Less exquisite than thine." She look'd: but all<br>
 Suffused with blushes &shy; neither self-possess'd<br>
 Nor startled, but betwixt this mood and that,<br>
 Divided in a graceful quiet &shy; paused,<br>
 And dropt the branch she held, and turning, wound<br>
 Her looser hair in braid, and stirr'd her lips<br>
 For some sweet answer, tho' no answer came,<br>
 Nor yet refused the rose, but granted it,<br>
 And moved away, and left me, statue-like,<br>
 In act to render thanks. I, that whole day,<br>
 Saw her no more, altho' I linger'd there<br>
 Till every daisy slept, and Love's white star<br>
 Beam'd thro' the thicken'd cedar in the dusk.<br>
 So home we went, and all the livelong way<br>
 With solemn gibe did Eustace banter me.<br>
 "Now," said he, "will you climb the top of Art;<br>
 You cannot fail but work in hues to dim<br>
 The Titianic Flora. Will you match<br>
 My Juliet? you, not you, &shy; the Master,<br>
 Love, A more ideal Artist he than all."<br>
<br>
 So home I went, but could not sleep for joy,<br>
 Reading her perfect features in the gloom,<br>
 Kissing the rose she gave me o'er and o'er,<br>
 And shaping faithful record of the glance<br>
 That graced the giving &shy; such a noise of life<br>
 Swarm'd in the golden present, such a voice<br>
 Call'd to me from the years to come, and such<br>
 A length of bright horizon rimm'd the dark.<br>
 And all that night I heard the watchmen peal<br>
 The sliding season: all that night I heard<br>
 The heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours.<br>
 The drowsy hours, dispensers of all good,<br>
 O'er the mute city stole with folded wings,<br>
 Distilling odours on me as they went<br>
 To greet their fairer sisters of the East.<br>
<br>
 Love at first sight, first-born, and heir to all,<br>
 Made this night thus. Henceforward squall nor storm<br>
 Could keep me from that Eden where she dwelt.<br>
 Light pretexts drew me: sometimes a<br>
 Dutch love For tulips; then for roses, moss or musk,<br>
 To grace my city-rooms; or fruits and cream<br>
 Served in the weeping elm; and more and more<br>
 A word could bring the colour to my cheek;<br>
 A thought would fill my eyes with happy dew;<br>
 Love trebled life within me, and with each<br>
 The year increased. The daughters of the year,<br>
 One after one, thro' that still garden pass'd:<br>
 Each garlanded with her peculiar flower<br>
 Danced into light, and died into the shade;<br>
 And each in passing touch'd with some new grace<br>
 <a name="foar"></a>Or seem'd to touch her, so that day by
day,<br>
 Like one that never can be wholly known,  <a href=
"#foa">6</a><br>
 Her beauty grew; till Autumn brought an hour<br>
 For Eustace, when I heard his deep "I will,"<br>
 Breathed, like the covenant of a God, to hold<br>
 From thence thro' all the worlds: but I rose up<br>
 <a name="fobr"></a>Full of his bliss, and following her dark
eyes<br>
 Felt earth as air beneath me,  <a href="#fob">7</a>  till I
reach'd<br>
 The wicket-gate, and found her standing there.<br>
 There sat we down upon a garden mound,<br>
 Two mutually enfolded; Love, the third,<br>
 Between us, in the circle of his arms<br>
 Enwound us both; and over many a range<br>
 Of waning lime the gray cathedral towers,<br>
 Across a hazy glimmer of the west,<br>
 Reveal'd their shining windows: from them clash'd<br>
 The bells; we listen'd; with the time we play'd;<br>
 We spoke of other things; we coursed about<br>
 The subject most at heart, more near and near,<br>
 <a name="focr"></a>Like doves about a dovecote, wheeling
round<br>
 The central wish, until we settled there.  <a href=
"#foc">8</a><br>
 Then, in that time and place, I spoke to her,<br>
 Requiring, tho' I knew it was mine own,<br>
 Yet for the pleasure that I took to hear,<br>
 Requiring at her hand the greatest gift,<br>
 A woman's heart, the heart of her I loved;<br>
 And in that time and place she answer'd me,<br>
 And in the compass of three little words,<br>
 More musical than ever came in one,<br>
 <a name="fodr"></a>The silver fragments of a broken voice,<br>
 Made me most happy, faltering  <a href="#fod">9</a>  "I am
thine".<br>
 Shall I cease here? Is this enough to say<br>
 That my desire, like all strongest hopes,<br>
 By its own energy fulfilled itself,<br>
 Merged in completion? Would you learn at full<br>
 How passion rose thro' circumstantial grades<br>
 Beyond all grades develop'd? and indeed<br>
 I had not staid so long to tell you all,<br>
 But while I mused came Memory with sad eyes,<br>
 Holding the folded annals of my youth;<br>
 And while I mused, Love with knit brows went by,<br>
 And with a flying finger swept my lips,<br>
 And spake, "Be wise: not easily forgiven<br>
 Are those, who setting wide the doors, that bar<br>
 The secret bridal chambers of the heart.<br>
 Let in the day". Here, then, my words have end.<br>
 Yet might I tell of meetings, of farewells &shy;<br>
 Of that which came between, more sweet than each,<br>
 In whispers, like the whispers of the leaves<br>
 That tremble round a nightingale &shy; in sighs<br>
 <a name="foer"></a>Which perfect Joy, perplex'd for
utterance,<br>
 Stole from her  <a href="#foe">10</a>  sister Sorrow. Might I
not tell<br>
 Of difference, reconcilement, pledges given,<br>
 And vows, where there was never need of vows,<br>
 And kisses, where the heart on one wild leap<br>
 Hung tranced from all pulsation, as above<br>
 The heavens between their fairy fleeces pale<br>
 Sow'd all their mystic gulfs with fleeting stars;<br>
 Or while the balmy glooming, crescent-lit,<br>
 Spread the light haze along the river-shores,<br>
 And in the hollows; or as once we met<br>
 Unheedful, tho' beneath a whispering rain<br>
 Night slid down one long stream of sighing wind,<br>
 And in her bosom bore the baby, Sleep.<br>
 But this whole hour your eyes have been intent<br>
 On that veil'd picture &shy; veil'd, for what it holds<br>
 May not be dwelt on by the common day.<br>
 This prelude has prepared thee. Raise thy soul;<br>
 Make thine heart ready with thine eyes: the time<br>
 Is come to raise the veil. Behold her there,<br>
 As I beheld her ere she knew my heart,<br>
 My first, last love; the idol of my youth,<br>
 The darling of my manhood, and, alas!<br>
 Now the most blessed memory of mine age.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section62">Dora</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842.<br>
<br>
This poem had been written as early as 1835, when it was read to
Fitzgerald and Spedding (<i>Life</i>, i., 182). No alterations
were made in the text after 1853. The story in this poem was
taken even to the minutest details from a prose story of Miss
Mitford's, namely, <i>The Tale of Dora Creswell</i> (<i>Our
Village</i>, vol. in., 242-53), the only alterations being in the
names, Farmer Cresswell, Dora Creswell, Walter Cresswell, and
Mary Hay becoming respectively Allan, Dora, William, and Mary
Morrison. How carefully the poet has preserved the picturesque
touches of the original may be seen by comparing the following
two passages: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>And Dora took the child, and went her way<br>
 Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound<br>
 That was unsown, where many poppies grew.<br>
 ...<br>
 She rose and took<br>
 The child once more, and sat upon the mound;<br>
 And made a little wreath of all the flowers<br>
 That grew about, and tied it round his hat.<br>
<br>
 "A beautiful child lay on the ground at some distance, whilst a
young girl, resting from the labour of reaping, was twisting a
rustic wreath of enamelled cornflowers, brilliant poppies ...
round its hat."</blockquote>

<br>
 The style is evidently modelled closely on that of the
<i>Odyssey</i>. <br>
<br>


<blockquote>With farmer Allan at the farm abode<br>
 William and Dora. William was his son,<br>
 And she his niece. He often look'd at them,<br>
 And often thought "I'll make them man and wife".<br>
 Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,<br>
 And yearn'd towards William; but the youth, because<br>
 He had been always with her in the house,<br>
 Thought not of Dora. Then there came a day<br>
 When Allan call'd his son, and said,<br>
 "My son: I married late, but I would wish to see<br>
 My grandchild on my knees before I die:<br>
 And I have set my heart upon a match.<br>
 Now therefore look to Dora; she is well<br>
 To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.<br>
 She is my brother's daughter: he and I<br>
 Had once hard words, and parted, and he died<br>
 In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred<br>
 His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;<br>
 For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,<br>
 For many years." But William answer'd short;<br>
 "I cannot marry Dora; by my life,<br>
 I will not marry Dora". Then the old man<br>
 Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:<br>
 "You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!<br>
 But in my time a father's word was law,<br>
 And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;<br>
 Consider, William: take a month to think,<br>
 And let me have an answer to my wish;<br>
 Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,<br>
 And never more darken my doors again."<br>
 <a name="fofr"></a>But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,<br>
 And broke away.  <a href="#fof">1</a>  The more he look'd at
her<br>
 The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;<br>
 But Dora bore them meekly. Then before<br>
 The month was out he left his father's house,<br>
 And hired himself to work within the fields;<br>
 And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed<br>
 A labourer's daughter, Mary Morrison.<br>
<br>
 Then, when the bells were ringing,<br>
 Allan call'd His niece and said: "My girl, I love you well;<br>
 But if you speak with him that was my son,<br>
 Or change a word with her he calls his wife,<br>
 My home is none of yours. My will is law."<br>
 And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,<br>
 "It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change!"<br>
<br>
 And days went on, and there was born a boy<br>
 To William; then distresses came on him;<br>
 And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,<br>
 Heart-broken, and his father helped him not.<br>
 But Dora stored what little she could save,<br>
 And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know<br>
 Who sent it; till at last a fever seized<br>
 On William, and in harvest time he died.<br>
<br>
 Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat<br>
 And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought<br>
 Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:<br>
 "I have obey'd my uncle until now,<br>
 And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me<br>
 This evil came on William at the first.<br>
 But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,<br>
 And for your sake, the woman that he chose,<br>
 And for this orphan, I am come to you:<br>
 You know there has not been for these five years<br>
 So full a harvest, let me take the boy,<br>
 And I will set him in my uncle's eye<br>
 Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad<br>
 Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,<br>
 And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."<br>
 And Dora took the child, and went her way<br>
 Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound<br>
 That was unsown, where many poppies grew.<br>
 Far off the farmer came into the field<br>
 And spied her not; for none of all his men<br>
 Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;<br>
 And Dora would have risen and gone to him,<br>
 But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd<br>
 And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.<br>
 But when the morrow came, she rose and took<br>
 The child once more, and sat upon the mound;<br>
 And made a little wreath of all the flowers<br>
 That grew about, and tied it round his hat<br>
 To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.<br>
 Then when the farmer passed into the field<br>
 He spied her, and he left his men at work,<br>
 And came and said: "Where were you yesterday?<br>
 Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"<br>
 So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,<br>
 And answer'd softly, "This is William's child?"<br>
 "And did I not," said Allan, "did I not<br>
 Forbid you, Dora?" Dora said again:<br>
 "Do with me as you will, but take the child<br>
 And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"<br>
 And Allan said: "I see it is a trick<br>
 Got up betwixt you and the woman there.<br>
 I must be taught my duty, and by you!<br>
 You knew my word was law, and yet you dared<br>
 To slight it. Well &shy; for I will take the boy;<br>
 But go you hence, and never see me more."<br>
 So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud<br>
 And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell<br>
 At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,<br>
 And the boy's cry came to her from the field,<br>
 More and more distant. She bow'd down her head,<br>
 Remembering the day when first she came,<br>
 And all the things that had been. She bow'd down<br>
 And wept in secret; and the reapers reap'd,<br>
 And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.<br>
 Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood<br>
 Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy<br>
 Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise<br>
 To God, that help'd her in her widowhood.<br>
 And Dora said, "My uncle took the boy;<br>
 But, Mary, let me live and work with you:<br>
 He says that he will never see me more".<br>
 Then answer'd Mary, "This shall never be,<br>
 That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:<br>
 And, now, I think, he shall not have the boy,<br>
 For he will teach him hardness, and to slight<br>
 His mother; therefore thou and I will go,<br>
 And I will have my boy, and bring him home;<br>
 And I will beg of him to take thee back;<br>
 But if he will not take thee back again,<br>
 Then thou and I will live within one house,<br>
 And work for William's child until he grows<br>
 Of age to help us." So the women kiss'd<br>
 Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm.<br>
 The door was off the latch: they peep'd, and saw<br>
 The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,<br>
 Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,<br>
 And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,<br>
 Like one that loved him; and the lad stretch'd out<br>
 And babbled for the golden seal, that hung<br>
 From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.<br>
 Then they came in: but when the boy beheld<br>
 His mother, he cried out to come to her:<br>
 And Allan set him down, and Mary said:<br>
 "O Father! &shy; if you let me call you so &shy;<br>
 I never came a-begging for myself,<br>
 Or William, or this child; but now I come<br>
 For Dora: take her back; she loves you well.<br>
 O Sir, when William died, he died at peace<br>
 With all men; for I ask'd him, and he said,<br>
 He could not ever rue his marrying me &shy;<br>
 I have been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said<br>
 That he was wrong to cross his father thus:<br>
 'God bless him!' he said, 'and may he never know<br>
 The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turn'd<br>
 His face and pass'd &shy; unhappy that I am!<br>
 But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you<br>
 Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight<br>
 His father's memory; and take Dora back,<br>
 And let all this be as it was before."<br>
 So Mary said, and Dora hid her face<br>
 By Mary. There was silence in the room;<br>
 And all at once the old man burst in sobs:<br>
 "I have been to blame &shy; to blame. I have kill'd my son.<br>
 I have kill'd him &shy; but I loved him &shy; my dear son.<br>
 May God forgive me! &shy; I have been to blame.<br>
 Kiss me, my children." Then they clung about<br>
 The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times.<br>
 And all the man was broken with remorse;<br>
 And all his love came back a hundredfold;<br>
 And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's child,<br>
 Thinking of William. So those four abode<br>
 Within one house together; and as years<br>
 Went forward, Mary took another mate;<br>
 But Dora lived unmarried till her death.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section63">Audley Court</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842.<br>
<br>
Only four alterations were made in the text after 1842, all of
which are duly noted. Tennyson told his son that the poem was
partially suggested by Abbey Park at Torquay where it was
written, and that the last lines described the scene from the
hill looking over the bay. He saw he said "a star of
phosphorescence made by the buoy appearing and disappearing in
the dark sea," but it is curious that the line describing that
was not inserted till long after the poem had been published. The
poem, though a trifle, is a triumph of felicitous description and
expression, whether we regard the pie or the moonlit bay.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>"The Bull, the Fleece are cramm'd, and not a room<br>
 For love or money. Let us picnic there<br>
 At Audley Court." I spoke, while Audley feast<br>
 Humm'd like a hive all round the narrow quay,<br>
 To Francis, with a basket on his arm,<br>
 To Francis just alighted from the boat,<br>
 <a name="fogr"></a>And breathing of the sea. "With all my
heart,"<br>
 Said Francis. Then we shoulder'd thro'  <a href="#fog">1</a> 
the swarm,<br>
 And rounded by the stillness of the beach<br>
 To where the bay runs up its latest horn.<br>
 We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp'd<br>
 The flat red granite; so by many a sweep<br>
 Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach'd<br>
 <a name="fohr"></a>The griffin-guarded gates and pass'd thro'
all<br>
 The pillar'd dusk  <a href="#foh">2</a>  of sounding
sycamores<br>
 And cross'd the garden to the gardener's lodge,<br>
 With all its casements bedded, and its walls<br>
 And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.<br>
 There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid<br>
 A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,<br>
 Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,<br>
 And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,<br>
 <a name="foir"></a>Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret
lay,<br>
 Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks  <a href=
"#foi">3</a><br>
 Imbedded and injellied; last with these,<br>
 A flask of cider from his father's vats,<br>
 Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and eat<br>
 And talk'd old matters over; who was dead,<br>
 Who married, who was like to be, and how<br>
 The races went, and who would rent the hall:<br>
 Then touch'd upon the game, how scarce it was<br>
 <a name="fojr"></a>This season; glancing thence, discuss'd the
farm,<br>
 The fourfield system, and the price of grain;  <a href=
"#foj">4</a><br>
 And struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,<br>
 And came again together on the king<br>
 With heated faces; till he laugh'd aloud;<br>
 And, while the blackbird on the pippin hung<br>
 To hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang &shy;<br>
 "Oh! who would fight and march and counter-march,<br>
 <a name="fokr"></a>Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field,<br>
 And shovell'd up into a  <a href="#fok">5</a>  bloody trench<br>
 Where no one knows? but let me live my life.<br>
 "Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,<br>
 Perch'd like a crow upon a three-legg'd stool,<br>
 Till all his juice is dried, and all his joints<br>
 Are full of chalk? but let me live my life.<br>
 "Who'd serve the state? for if I carved my name<br>
 Upon the cliffs that guard my native land,<br>
 I might as well have traced it in the sands;<br>
 The sea wastes all: but let me live my life.<br>
 "Oh! who would love? I wooed a woman once,<br>
 But she was sharper than an eastern wind,<br>
 And all my heart turn'd from her, as a thorn<br>
 Turns from the sea: but let me live my life."<br>
 He sang his song, and I replied with mine:<br>
 I found it in a volume, all of songs,<br>
 Knock'd down to me, when old Sir Robert's pride,<br>
 His books &shy; the more the pity, so I said &shy;<br>
 Came to the hammer here in March &shy; and this &shy;<br>
 I set the words, and added names I knew.<br>
 "Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep and dream of me:<br>
 Sleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister's arm,<br>
 And sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine.<br>
 "Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia's arm;<br>
 Emilia, fairer than all else but thou,<br>
 For thou art fairer than all else that is.<br>
 "Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:<br>
 Sleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:<br>
 I go to-night: I come to-morrow morn.<br>
 "I go, but I return: I would I were<br>
 The pilot of the darkness and the dream.<br>
 Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me."<br>
 So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,<br>
 The farmer's son who lived across the bay,<br>
 My friend; and I, that having wherewithal,<br>
 <a name="folr"></a>And in the fallow leisure of my life<br>
 A rolling stone of here and everywhere,  <a href=
"#fol">6</a><br>
 Did what I would; but ere the night we rose<br>
 And saunter'd home beneath a moon that, just<br>
 In crescent, dimly rain'd about the leaf<br>
 Twilights of airy silver, till we reach'd<br>
 The limit of the hills; and as we sank<br>
 From rock to rock upon the gloomy quay,<br>
 <a name="fomr"></a>The town was hush'd beneath us: lower
down<br>
 <a name="fonr"></a>The bay was oily-calm: the harbour buoy<br>
 With one green sparkle ever and anon  <a href="#fom">7</a><br>
 Dipt by itself, and we were glad at heart.  <a href=

<h3><a name="section64">Walking to the Mail</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842. Not altered in any respect after
1853.<br>
<br>
<br>


<blockquote><i>John</i>. I'm glad I walk'd.<br>
 How fresh the meadows look<br>
 Above the river, and, but a month ago,<br>
 The whole hill-side was redder than a fox.<br>
 <a name="foor"></a> Is yon plantation where this byway joins<br>
 The turnpike?  <a href="#foo">1</a><br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. Yes.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. And when does this come by?<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. The mail? At one o'clock.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. What is it now?<br>
<br>
 <a name="fopr"></a><i>James</i>. A quarter to.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. Whose house is that I see?  <a href=
"#fop">2</a><br>
No, not the County Member's with the vane:<br>
Up higher with the yewtree by it, and half<br>
A score of gables.<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. That? Sir Edward Head's:<br>
But he's abroad: the place is to be sold.<br>
<i>John</i>. Oh, his. He was not broken?<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. No, sir, he,<br>
Vex'd with a morbid devil in his blood<br>
That veil'd the world with jaundice, hid his face<br>
From all men, and commercing with himself,<br>
He lost the sense that handles daily life &shy;<br>
That keeps us all in order more or less &shy;<br>
And sick of home went overseas for change.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. And whither?<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. Nay, who knows? he's here and there.<br>
But let him go; his devil goes with him,<br>
As well as with his tenant, Jockey Dawes.<br>
<br>
 <a name="foqr"></a><i>John</i>. What's that?<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. You saw the man &shy; on Monday, was it? &shy;  <a
href="#foq">3</a><br>
There by the hump-back'd willow; half stands up<br>
And bristles; half has fall'n and made a bridge;<br>
And there he caught the younker tickling trout &shy;<br>
Caught in <i>flagrante</i> &shy; what's the Latin word? &shy;<br>
<i>Delicto</i>; but his house, for so they say,<br>
Was haunted with a jolly ghost, that shook<br>
The curtains, whined in lobbies, tapt at doors,<br>
And rummaged like a rat: no servant stay'd:<br>
The farmer vext packs up his beds and chairs,<br>
And all his household stuff; and with his boy<br>
 <a name="forr1"></a>Betwixt his knees, his wife upon the
tilt,<br>
Sets out,  <a href="#for1">4</a>  and meets a friend who hails
him,<br>
"What! You're flitting!" "Yes, we're flitting," says the
ghost<br>
(For they had pack'd the thing among the beds).<br>
 <a name="fosr"></a>"Oh, well," says he, "you flitting with us
too &shy;<br>
Jack, turn the horses' heads and home again".  <a href=
"#fos">5</a><br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. He left <i>his</i> wife behind; for so I heard.<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. He left her, yes. I met my lady once:<br>
A woman like a butt, and harsh as crabs.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. Oh, yet, but I remember, ten years back &shy;<br>
'Tis now at least ten years &shy; and then she was &shy;<br>
You could not light upon a sweeter thing:<br>
A body slight and round and like a pear<br>
In growing, modest eyes, a hand a foot<br>
Lessening in perfect cadence, and a skin<br>
As clean and white as privet when it flowers.<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. Ay, ay, the blossom fades and they that loved<br>
At first like dove and dove were cat and dog.<br>
She was the daughter of a cottager,<br>
Out of her sphere. What betwixt shame and pride,<br>
New things and old, himself and her, she sour'd<br>
To what she is: a nature never kind!<br>
Like men, like manners: like breeds like, they say.<br>
Kind nature is the best: those manners next<br>
That fit us like a nature second-hand;<br>
Which are indeed the manners of the great.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. But I had heard it was this bill that past,<br>
And fear of change at home, that drove him hence.<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. That was the last drop in the cup of gall.<br>
I once was near him, when his bailiff brought<br>
A Chartist pike. You should have seen him wince<br>
As from a venomous thing: he thought himself<br>
A mark for all, and shudder'd, lest a cry<br>
Should break his sleep by night, and his nice eyes<br>
Should see the raw mechanic's bloody thumbs<br>
Sweat on his blazon'd chairs; but, sir, you know<br>
That these two parties still divide the world &shy;<br>
Of those that want, and those that have: and still<br>
 <a name="fotr"></a>The same old sore breaks out from age to
age<br>
With much the same result. Now I myself,  <a href=
"#fot">6</a><br>
A Tory to the quick, was as a boy<br>
Destructive, when I had not what I would.<br>
I was at school &shy; a college in the South:<br>
There lived a flayflint near; we stole his fruit,<br>
His hens, his eggs; but there was law for <i>us</i>;<br>
 <a name="four"></a>We paid in person. He had a sow, sir.
She,<br>
With meditative grunts of much content,  <a href="#fou">7</a><br>
Lay great with pig, wallowing in sun and mud.<br>
By night we dragg'd her to the college tower<br>
From her warm bed, and up the corkscrew stair<br>
With hand and rope we haled the groaning sow,<br>
And on the leads we kept her till she pigg'd.<br>
Large range of prospect had the mother sow,<br>
And but for daily loss of one she loved,<br>
As one by one we took them &shy; but for this &shy;<br>
As never sow was higher in this world &shy;<br>
Might have been happy: but what lot is pure!<br>
We took them all, till she was left alone<br>
Upon her tower, the Niobe of swine,<br>
And so return'd unfarrowed to her sty.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. They found you out?<br>
<br>
 <i>James</i>. Not they.<br>
<br>
 <i>John</i>. Well &shy; after all &shy; What know we of the
secret of a man?<br>
His nerves were wrong. What ails us, who are sound,<br>
That we should mimic this raw fool the world,<br>
Which charts us all in its coarse blacks or whites,<br>
As ruthless as a baby with a worm,<br>
As cruel as a schoolboy ere he grows<br>
To Pity &shy; more from ignorance than will,<br>
But put your best foot forward, or I fear<br>
That we shall miss the mail: and here it comes<br>
With five at top: as quaint a four-in-hand<br>
As you shall see &shy; three pyebalds and a roan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is a house in East Halton which is haunted by
a hob-thrush.... Some years ago, it is said, a family who had
lived in the house for more than a hundred years were much
annoyed by it, and determined to quit the dwelling. They had
placed their goods on a waggon, and were just on the point of
starting when a neighbour asked the farmer whether he was
leaving. On this the hobthrush put his head out of the
splash-churn, which was amongst the household stuff, and said,
'Ay, we're flitting'. Whereupon the farmer decided to give up the
attempt to escape from it and remain where he was."</blockquote>

The same story is told of a Cluricaune in Croker's <i>Fairy
Legends and Traditions</i> in the South of Ireland. See <i>The
Haunted Cellar</i> in p. 81 of the edition of 1862, and as
Tennyson has elsewhere in <i>Guinevere</i> borrowed a passage
from the same story (see <i>Illustrations of Tennyson</i>, p.
152) it is probable that that was the source of the story here,
though there the Cluricaune uses the expression, "Here we go
altogether".<br>

<h3><a name="section65">Edwin Morris, or The Lake</a></h3>

<br>
This poem first appeared in the seventh edition of the
<i>Poems</i>, 1851. It was written at Llanberis. Several
alterations were made in the eighth edition of 1853, since then
none, with the exception of "breath" for "breaths" in line
66.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>O Me, my pleasant rambles by the lake,<br>
 My sweet, wild, fresh three-quarters of a year,<br>
 My one Oasis in the dust and drouth<br>
 Of city life! I was a sketcher then:<br>
 See here, my doing: curves of mountain, bridge,<br>
 Boat, island, ruins of a castle, built<br>
 When men knew how to build, upon a rock,<br>
 With turrets lichen-gilded like a rock:<br>
 And here, new-comers in an ancient hold,<br>
 New-comers from the Mersey, millionaires,<br>
 Here lived the Hills &shy; a Tudor-chimnied bulk<br>
 Of mellow brickwork on an isle of bowers.<br>
 O me, my pleasant rambles by the lake<br>
 With Edwin Morris and with Edward Bull<br>
 The curate; he was fatter than his cure.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fovr"></a>But Edwin Morris, he that knew the names,<br>
 Long-learned names of agaric, moss and fern,  <a href=
"#fov">1</a><br>
 Who forged a thousand theories of the rocks,<br>
 Who taught me how to skate, to row, to swim,<br>
 Who read me rhymes elaborately good,<br>
 <a name="fowr"></a>His own &shy; I call'd him Crichton, for he
seem'd<br>
 All-perfect, finish'd to the finger nail.  <a href=
"#fow">2</a><br>
 And once I ask'd him of his early life,<br>
 And his first passion; and he answer'd me;<br>
 And well his words became him: was he not<br>
 A full-cell'd honeycomb of eloquence<br>
 Stored from all flowers? Poet-like he spoke.<br>
<br>
 "My love for Nature is as old as I;<br>
 But thirty moons, one honeymoon to that,<br>
 And three rich sennights more, my love for her.<br>
 <a name="foxr"></a>My love for Nature and my love for her,<br>
 Of different ages, like twin-sisters grew,  <a href=
"#fox">3</a><br>
 Twin-sisters differently beautiful.<br>
 To some full music rose and sank the sun,<br>
 And some full music seem'd to move and change<br>
 With all the varied changes of the dark,<br>
 And either twilight and the day between;<br>
 For daily hope fulfill'd, to rise again<br>
 <a name="foyr"></a>Revolving toward fulfilment, made it
sweet<br>
 To walk, to sit, to sleep, to wake, to breathe."  <a href=
"#foy">4</a><br>
<br>
 Or this or something like to this he spoke.<br>
 Then said the fat-faced curate Edward Bull,<br>
 "I take it, God made the woman for the man,<br>
 And for the good and increase of the world,<br>
 A pretty face is well, and this is well,<br>
 To have a dame indoors, that trims us up,<br>
 And keeps us tight; but these unreal ways<br>
 Seem but the theme of writers, and indeed<br>
 Worn threadbare. Man is made of solid stuff.<br>
 I say, God made the woman for the man,<br>
 And for the good and increase of the world."<br>
<br>
 "Parson," said I, "you pitch the pipe too low:<br>
 But I have sudden touches, and can run<br>
 My faith beyond my practice into his:<br>
 Tho' if, in dancing after Letty Hill,<br>
 <a name="fozr"></a>I do not hear the bells upon my cap,<br>
 I scarce hear  <a href="#foz">5</a>  other music: yet say
on.<br>
 What should one give to light on such a dream?"<br>
 I ask'd him half-sardonically.<br>
 "Give? Give all thou art," he answer'd, and a light<br>
 Of laughter dimpled in his swarthy cheek;<br>
 "I would have hid her needle in my heart,<br>
 To save her little finger from a scratch<br>
 No deeper than the skin: my ears could hear<br>
 Her lightest breaths: her least remark was worth<br>
 The experience of the wise. I went and came;<br>
 Her voice fled always thro' the summer land;<br>
 I spoke her name alone. Thrice-happy days!<br>
 The flower of each, those moments when we met,<br>
 The crown of all, we met to part no more."<br>
<br>
 Were not his words delicious, I a beast<br>
 To take them as I did? but something jarr'd;<br>
 Whether he spoke too largely; that there seem'd<br>
 A touch of something false, some self-conceit,<br>
 Or over-smoothness: howsoe'er it was,<br>
 He scarcely hit my humour, and I said: &shy;<br>
<br>
 "Friend Edwin, do not think yourself alone<br>
 Of all men happy. Shall not Love to me,<br>
 <a name="fpar"></a>As in the Latin song I learnt at school,<br>
 Sneeze out a full God-bless-you right and left?  <a href=
"#fpa">6</a><br>
 But you can talk: yours is a kindly vein:<br>
 I have I think &shy; Heaven knows &shy; as much within;<br>
 <a name="fpbr"></a>Have or should have, but for a thought or
two,<br>
 That like a purple beech  <a href="#fpb">7</a>  among the
greens<br>
 Looks out of place: 'tis from no want in her:<br>
 It is my shyness, or my self-distrust,<br>
 Or something of a wayward modern mind<br>
 Dissecting passion. Time will set me right."<br>
<br>
 So spoke I knowing not the things that were.<br>
 Then said the fat-faced curate, Edward Bull:<br>
 "God made the woman for the use of man,<br>
 And for the good and increase of the world".<br>
 And I and Edwin laugh'd; and now we paused<br>
 About the windings of the marge to hear<br>
 <a name="fpcr"></a>The soft wind blowing over meadowy holms<br>
 And alders, garden-isles  <a href="#fpc">8</a>  ; and now we
left<br>
 The clerk behind us, I and he, and ran<br>
 By ripply shallows of the lisping lake,<br>
 Delighted with the freshness and the sound.<br>
 But, when the bracken rusted on their crags,<br>
 My suit had wither'd, nipt to death by him<br>
 <a name="fpdr"></a>That was a God, and is a lawyer's clerk,<br>
 The rentroll Cupid of our rainy isles.  <a href="#fpd">9</a><br>
<br>
 ' <a name="fper"></a>Tis true, we met; one hour I had, no
more:<br>
 She sent a note, the seal an <i>Elle vous suit</i>,  <a href=
"#fpe">10</a><br>
 The close "Your Letty, only yours"; and this<br>
 Thrice underscored. The friendly mist of morn<br>
 Clung to the lake. I boated over, ran<br>
 My craft aground, and heard with beating heart<br>
 The Sweet-Gale rustle round the shelving keel;<br>
 <a name="fpfr"></a>And out I stept, and up I crept: she
moved,<br>
 Like Proserpine in Enna, gathering flowers:  <a href=
"#fpf">11</a><br>
 Then low and sweet I whistled thrice; and she,<br>
 She turn'd, we closed, we kiss'd, swore faith, I breathed<br>
 In some new planet: a silent cousin stole<br>
 Upon us and departed: "Leave," she cried,<br>
 "O leave me!" "Never, dearest, never: here<br>
 I brave the worst:" and while we stood like fools<br>
 Embracing, all at once a score of pugs<br>
 And poodles yell'd within, and out they came<br>
 Trustees and Aunts and Uncles. "What, with him!<br>
 "Go" (shrill'd the cottonspinning chorus) "him!"<br>
 I choked. Again they shriek'd the burthen "Him!"<br>
 <a name="fpgr"></a>Again with hands of wild rejection "Go!
&shy;<br>
 Girl, get you in!" She went &shy; and in one month  <a href=
"#fpg">12</a><br>
 They wedded her to sixty thousand pounds,<br>
 To lands in Kent and messuages in York,<br>
 And slight Sir Robert with his watery smile<br>
 And educated whisker. But for me,<br>
 They set an ancient creditor to work:<br>
 It seems I broke a close with force and arms:<br>
 There came a mystic token from the king<br>
 To greet the sheriff, needless courtesy!<br>
 I read, and fled by night, and flying turn'd:<br>
 Her taper glimmer'd in the lake below:<br>
 <a name="fphr"></a>I turn'd once more, close-button'd to the
storm;<br>
 So left the place,  <a href="#fph">13</a>  left Edwin, nor have
seen<br>
 Him since, nor heard of her, nor cared to hear.<br>
 Nor cared to hear? perhaps; yet long ago<br>
 I have pardon'd little Letty; not indeed,<br>
 It may be, for her own dear sake but this,<br>
 She seems a part of those fresh days to me;<br>
 For in the dust and drouth of London life<br>
 She moves among my visions of the lake,<br>
 While the prime swallow dips his wing, or then<br>
 While the gold-lily blows, and overhead<br>
 The light cloud smoulders on the summer crag.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section66">St Simon Stylites</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842, reprinted in all the subsequent editions
of the poems but with no alterations in the text, except that in
eighth line from the end "my" was substituted for "mine" in 1846.
Tennyson informed a friend that it was not from the <i>Acta
Sanctorum</i>, but from Hone's <i>Every-Day Book</i>, vol. i.,
pp. 35-36, that he got the material for this poem, and a
comparison with the narrative in Hone and the poem seems to show
that this was the case.<br>
<br>
It is not easy to identify the St. Simeon Stylites of Hone's
narrative and Tennyson's poem, whether he is to be identified
with St. Simeon the Elder, of whom there are three memoirs given
in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, tom. i., 5th January, 261-286, or
with St. Simeon Stylites, Junior, of whom there is an elaborate
biography in Greek by Nicephorus printed with a Latin translation
and notes in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, tom. v., 24th May,
298-401. It seems clear that whoever compiled the account
popularised by Hone had read both and amalgamated them. The main
lines in the story of both saints are exactly the same. Both
stood on columns, both tortured themselves in the same ways, both
wrought miracles, and both died at their posts of penance. St.
Simeon the Elder was born at Sisan in Syria about A.D. 390, and
was buried at Antioch in A.D. 459 or 460. The Simeon the Younger
was born at Antioch A. D. 521 and died in A.D. 592. His life,
which is of singular interest, is much more elaborately
related.<br>
<br>
This poem is not simply a dramatic study. It bears very directly
on Tennyson's philosophy of life. In these early poems he has
given us four studies in the morbid anatomy of character: <i>The
Palace of Art</i>, which illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and
intellectual enjoyment of self; <i>The Vision of Sin</i>, which
illustrates the effects of similar indulgence in the grosser
pleasures of the senses; <i>The Two Voices</i>, which illustrates
the mischief of despondent self-absorption, while the present
poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an opposite
extreme, asceticism affected for the mere gratification of
personal vanity.<br>
<br>
<br>


<blockquote>Altho' I be the basest of mankind,<br>
 From scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin,<br>
 Unfit for earth, unfit for heaven, scarce meet<br>
 For troops of devils, mad with blasphemy,<br>
 I will not cease to grasp the hope I hold<br>
 Of saintdom, and to clamour, morn and sob,<br>
 Battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer,<br>
 Have mercy, Lord, and take away my sin.<br>
 Let this avail, just, dreadful, mighty God,<br>
 This not be all in vain that thrice ten years,<br>
 Thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs,<br>
 In hungers and in thirsts, fevers and cold,<br>
 In coughs, aches, stitches, ulcerous throes and cramps,<br>
 A sign betwixt the meadow and the cloud,<br>
 Patient on this tall pillar I have borne<br>
 Rain, wind, frost, heat, hail, damp, and sleet, and snow;<br>
 And I had hoped that ere this period closed<br>
 Thou wouldst have caught me up into Thy rest,<br>
 Denying not these weather-beaten limbs<br>
 The meed of saints, the white robe and the palm.<br>
 O take the meaning, Lord: I do not breathe,<br>
 Not whisper, any murmur of complaint.<br>
 Pain heap'd ten-hundred-fold to this, were still<br>
 Less burthen, by ten-hundred-fold, to bear,<br>
 Than were those lead-like tons of sin, that crush'd<br>
 My spirit flat before thee. O Lord, Lord,<br>
 Thou knowest I bore this better at the first,<br>
 For I was strong and hale of body then;<br>
 And tho' my teeth, which now are dropt away,<br>
 Would chatter with the cold, and all my beard<br>
 Was tagg'd with icy fringes in the moon,<br>
 I drown'd the whoopings of the owl with sound<br>
 Of pious hymns and psalms, and sometimes saw<br>
 An angel stand and watch me, as I sang.<br>
 Now am I feeble grown; my end draws nigh;<br>
 I hope my end draws nigh: half deaf I am,<br>
 So that I scarce can hear the people hum<br>
 About the column's base, and almost blind,<br>
 And scarce can recognise the fields I know;<br>
 And both my thighs are rotted with the dew;<br>
 Yet cease I not to clamour and to cry,<br>
 While my stiff spine can hold my weary head,<br>
 Till all my limbs drop piecemeal from the stone,<br>
 Have mercy, mercy: take away my sin.<br>
 O Jesus, if thou wilt not save my soul,<br>
 Who may be saved? who is it may be saved?<br>
 Who may be made a saint, if I fail here?<br>
 Show me the man hath suffered more than I.<br>
 For did not all thy martyrs die one death?<br>
 For either they were stoned, or crucified,<br>
 Or burn'd in fire, or boil'd in oil, or sawn<br>
 In twain beneath the ribs; but I die here<br>
 To-day, and whole years long, a life of death.<br>
 Bear witness, if I could have found a way<br>
 (And heedfully I sifted all my thought)<br>
 More slowly-painful to subdue this home<br>
 Of sin, my flesh, which I despise and hate,<br>
 <a name="fpir"></a>I had not stinted practice, O my God.<br>
 For not alone this pillar-punishment,  <a href="#fpi">1</a><br>
 Not this alone I bore: but while I lived<br>
 In the white convent down the valley there,<br>
 For many weeks about my loins I wore<br>
 The rope that haled the buckets from the well,<br>
 Twisted as tight as I could knot the noose;<br>
 And spake not of it to a single soul,<br>
 Until the ulcer, eating thro' my skin,<br>
 Betray'd my secret penance, so that all<br>
 <a name="fpjr"></a>My brethren marvell'd greatly. More than
this<br>
 I bore, whereof, O God, thou knowest all.  <a href=
"#fpj">2</a><br>
 Three winters, that my soul might grow to thee,<br>
 I lived up there on yonder mountain side.<br>
 My right leg chain'd into the crag, I lay<br>
 Pent in a roofless close of ragged stones;<br>
 Inswathed sometimes in wandering mist, and twice<br>
 Black'd with thy branding thunder, and sometimes<br>
 Sucking the damps for drink, and eating not,<br>
 Except the spare chance-gift of those that came<br>
 To touch my body and be heal'd, and live:<br>
 And they say then that I work'd miracles,<br>
 Whereof my fame is loud amongst mankind,<br>
 Cured lameness, palsies, cancers. Thou, O God,<br>
 Knowest alone whether this was or no.<br>
 <a name="fpkr"></a>Have mercy, mercy; cover all my sin.<br>
<br>
 Then, that I might be more alone with thee,  <a href=
"#fpk">3</a><br>
 Three years I lived upon a pillar, high<br>
 Six cubits, and three years on one of twelve;<br>
 And twice three years I crouch'd on one that rose<br>
 Twenty by measure; last of all, I grew<br>
 Twice ten long weary weary years to this,<br>
 That numbers forty cubits from the soil.<br>
 I think that I have borne as much as this &shy;<br>
 Or else I dream &shy; and for so long a time,<br>
 If I may measure time by yon slow light,<br>
 And this high dial, which my sorrow crowns &shy;<br>
 So much &shy; even so. And yet I know not well,<br>
 For that the evil ones comes here, and say,<br>
 "Fall down, O Simeon: thou hast suffer'd long<br>
 For ages and for ages!" then they prate<br>
 Of penances I cannot have gone thro',<br>
 Perplexing me with lies; and oft I fall,<br>
 Maybe for months, in such blind lethargies,<br>
 That Heaven, and Earth, and Time are choked. But yet<br>
 Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints<br>
 Enjoy themselves in Heaven, and men on earth<br>
 House in the shade of comfortable roofs,<br>
 Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food,<br>
 And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls,<br>
 I, 'tween the spring and downfall of the light,<br>
 Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,<br>
 To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints;<br>
 Or in the night, after a little sleep,<br>
 I wake: the chill stars sparkle; I am wet<br>
 With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost.<br>
 I wear an undress'd goatskin on my back;<br>
 A grazing iron collar grinds my neck;<br>
 And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross,<br>
 And strive and wrestle with thee till I die:<br>
 O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin.<br>
 O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am;<br>
 A sinful man, conceived and born in sin:<br>
 'Tis their own doing; this is none of mine;<br>
 Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this,<br>
 That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha!<br>
 They think that I am somewhat. What am I?<br>
 The silly people take me for a saint,<br>
 And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers:<br>
 And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here)<br>
 Have all in all endured as much, and more<br>
 Than many just and holy men, whose names<br>
 Are register'd and calendar'd for saints.<br>
 Good people, you do ill to kneel to me.<br>
 What is it I can have done to merit this?<br>
 <a name="fplr"></a>I am a sinner viler than you all.<br>
 It may be I have wrought some miracles,  <a href=
"#fpl">4</a><br>
 And cured some halt and maim'd; but what of that?<br>
 It may be, no one, even among the saints,<br>
 May match his pains with mine; but what of that?<br>
 Yet do not rise: for you may look on me,<br>
 And in your looking you may kneel to God.<br>
 Speak! is there any of you halt or maim'd?<br>
 I think you know I have some power with Heaven<br>
 From my long penance: let him speak his wish.<br>
 Yes, I can heal. Power goes forth from me.<br>
 They say that they are heal'd. Ah, hark! they shout<br>
 "St. Simeon Stylites". Why, if so,<br>
 God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul,<br>
 God reaps a harvest in thee. If this be,<br>
 Can I work miracles and not be saved?<br>
 This is not told of any. They were saints.<br>
 It cannot be but that I shall be saved;<br>
 Yea, crown'd a saint. They shout, "Behold a saint!"<br>
 And lower voices saint me from above.<br>
 Courage, St. Simeon! This dull chrysalis<br>
 Cracks into shining wings, and hope ere death<br>
 Spreads more and more and more, that God hath now<br>
 Sponged and made blank of crimeful record all<br>
 My mortal archives. O my sons, my sons,<br>
 I, Simeon of the pillar, by surname Stylites, among men;<br>
 I, Simeon, The watcher on the column till the end;<br>
 I, Simeon, whose brain the sunshine bakes;<br>
 I, whose bald brows in silent hours become<br>
 Unnaturally hoar with rime, do now<br>
 From my high nest of penance here proclaim<br>
 That Pontius and Iscariot by my side<br>
 Show'd like fair seraphs. On the coals I lay,<br>
 <a name="fpmr"></a>A vessel full of sin: all hell beneath<br>
 Made me boil over. Devils pluck'd my sleeve;  <a href=
"#fpm">5</a><br>
 Abaddon and Asmodeus caught at me.<br>
 I smote them with the cross; they swarm'd again.<br>
 In bed like monstrous apes they crush'd my chest:<br>
 They flapp'd my light out as I read: I saw<br>
 Their faces grow between me and my book:<br>
 With colt-like whinny and with hoggish whine<br>
 They burst my prayer. Yet this way was left,<br>
 And by this way I'scaped them. Mortify<br>
 Your flesh, like me, with scourges and with thorns;<br>
 Smite, shrink not, spare not. If it may be, fast<br>
 Whole Lents, and pray. I hardly, with slow steps,<br>
 With slow, faint steps, and much exceeding pain,<br>
 Have scrambled past those pits of fire, that still<br>
 Sing in mine ears. But yield not me the praise:<br>
 God only thro' his bounty hath thought fit,<br>
 Among the powers and princes of this world,<br>
 To make me an example to mankind,<br>
 Which few can reach to. Yet I do not say<br>
 But that a time may come &shy; yea, even now,<br>
 Now, now, his footsteps smite the threshold stairs<br>
 Of life &shy; I say, that time is at the doors<br>
 When you may worship me without reproach;<br>
 For I will leave my relics in your land,<br>
 And you may carve a shrine about my dust,<br>
 And burn a fragrant lamp before my bones,<br>
 When I am gather'd to the glorious saints.<br>
 While I spake then, a sting of shrewdest pain<br>
 Ran shrivelling thro' me, and a cloudlike change,<br>
 In passing, with a grosser film made thick<br>
 These heavy, horny eyes. The end! the end!<br>
 Surely the end! What's here? a shape, a shade,<br>
 A flash of light. Is that the angel there<br>
 That holds a crown? Come, blessed brother, come,<br>
 I know thy glittering face. I waited long;<br>
 My brows are ready. What! deny it now?<br>
 <a name="fpnr"></a>Nay, draw, draw, draw nigh. So I clutch it.
Christ!<br>
 'Tis gone: 'tis here again; the crown! the crown!  <a href=
"#fpn">6</a><br>
 So now 'tis fitted on and grows to me,<br>
 And from it melt the dews of Paradise,<br>
 Sweet! sweet! spikenard, and balm, and frankincense.<br>
 Ah! let me not be fool'd, sweet saints: I trust<br>
 That I am whole, and clean, and meet for Heaven.<br>
 Speak, if there be a priest, a man of God,<br>
 Among you there, and let him presently<br>
 Approach, and lean a ladder on the shaft,<br>
 And climbing up into my airy home,<br>
 Deliver me the blessed sacrament;<br>
 For by the warning of the Holy Ghost,<br>
 <a name="fpor"></a>I prophesy that I shall die to-night,<br>
 A quarter before twelve.  <a href="#fpo">7</a>  But thou, O
Lord,<br>
 Aid all this foolish people; let them take<br>
 Example, pattern: lead them to thy light.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section67">The Talking Oak</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842, and republished in all subsequent
editions with only two slight alterations: in line 113 a mere
variant in spelling, and in line 185, where in place of the
present reading the editions between 1842 and 1848 read, "For,
ah! the Dryad-days were brief".<br>
<br>
Tennyson told Mr. Aubrey de Vere that the poem was an experiment
meant to test the degree in which it is in the power of poetry to
humanise external nature. Tennyson might have remembered that
Ovid had made the same experiment nearly two thousand years ago,
while Goethe had immediately anticipated him in his charming
<i>Der Junggesett und der M&uuml;hlbach</i>. There was certainly
no novelty in such an attempt. The poem is in parts charmingly
written, but the oak is certainly "garrulously given," and comes
perilously near to tediousness.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>Once more the gate behind me falls;<br>
 Once more before my face<br>
 I see the moulder'd Abbey-walls,<br>
 That stand within the chace.<br>
<br>
 Beyond the lodge the city lies,<br>
 Beneath its drift of smoke;<br>
 And ah! with what delighted eyes<br>
 I turn to yonder oak.<br>
<br>
 For when my passion first began,<br>
 Ere that, which in me burn'd,<br>
 The love, that makes me thrice a man,<br>
 Could hope itself return'd;<br>
<br>
 To yonder oak within the field<br>
 I spoke without restraint,<br>
 And with a larger faith appeal'd<br>
 Than Papist unto Saint.<br>
<br>
 For oft I talk'd with him apart,<br>
 And told him of my choice,<br>
 Until he plagiarised a heart,<br>
 And answer'd with a voice.<br>
<br>
 Tho' what he whisper'd, under Heaven<br>
 None else could understand;<br>
 I found him garrulously given,<br>
 A babbler in the land.<br>
<br>
 But since I heard him make reply<br>
 Is many a weary hour;<br>
 'Twere well to question him, and try<br>
 If yet he keeps the power.<br>
<br>
 Hail, hidden to the knees in fern,<br>
 Broad Oak of Sumner-chace,<br>
 Whose topmost branches can discern<br>
 The roofs of Sumner-place!<br>
<br>
 Say thou, whereon I carved her name,<br>
 If ever maid or spouse,<br>
 As fair as my Olivia, came<br>
 To rest beneath thy boughs. &shy;<br>
<br>
 "O Walter, I have shelter'd here<br>
 Whatever maiden grace<br>
 The good old Summers, year by year,<br>
 Made ripe in Sumner-chace:<br>
<br>
 "Old Summers, when the monk was fat,<br>
 And, issuing shorn and sleek,<br>
 Would twist his girdle tight, and pat<br>
 The girls upon the cheek.<br>
<br>
 "Ere yet, in scorn of Peter's-pence,<br>
 <a name="fpqr"></a>And number'd bead, and shrift,<br>
 Bluff Harry broke into the spence,  <a href="#fpq">1</a><br>
 And turn'd the cowls adrift:<br>
<br>
 "And I have seen some score of those<br>
 Fresh faces, that would thrive<br>
 When his man-minded offset rose<br>
 To chase the deer at five;<br>
<br>
 "And all that from the town would stroll,<br>
 Till that wild wind made work<br>
 In which the gloomy brewer's soul<br>
 Went by me, like a stork:<br>
<br>
 "The slight she-slips of loyal blood,<br>
 And others, passing praise,<br>
 <a name="fprr1"></a>Strait-laced, but all too full in bud<br>
 For puritanic stays:  <a href="#fpr1">2</a><br>
<br>
 "And I have shadow'd many a group<br>
 Of beauties, that were born<br>
 In teacup-times of hood and hoop,<br>
 Or while the patch was worn;<br>
<br>
 "And, leg and arm with love-knots gay,<br>
 About me leap'd and laugh'd<br>
 The Modish Cupid of the day,<br>
 And shrill'd his tinsel shaft.<br>
<br>
 "I swear (and else may insects prick<br>
 Each leaf into a gall)<br>
 This girl, for whom your heart is sick,<br>
 Is three times worth them all;<br>
<br>
 "For those and theirs, by Nature's law,<br>
 Have faded long ago;<br>
 But in these latter springs I saw<br>
 Your own Olivia blow,<br>
<br>
 "From when she gamboll'd on the greens,<br>
 A baby-germ, to when<br>
 The maiden blossoms of her teens<br>
 Could number five from ten.<br>
<br>
 "I swear, by leaf, and wind, and rain<br>
 (And hear me with thine ears),<br>
 That, tho' I circle in the grain<br>
 Five hundred rings of years &shy;<br>
<br>
 "Yet, since I first could cast a shade,<br>
 Did never creature pass<br>
 So slightly, musically made,<br>
 So light upon the grass:<br>
<br>
 "For as to fairies, that will flit<br>
 To make the greensward fresh,<br>
 I hold them exquisitely knit,<br>
 But far too spare of flesh."<br>
<br>
 Oh, hide thy knotted knees in fern,<br>
 And overlook the chace;<br>
 And from thy topmost branch discern<br>
 The roofs of Sumner-place.<br>
<br>
 But thou, whereon I carved her name,<br>
 That oft hast heard my vows,<br>
 Declare when last Olivia came<br>
 To sport beneath thy boughs.<br>
<br>
 "O yesterday, you know, the fair<br>
 Was holden at the town;<br>
 Her father left his good arm-chair,<br>
 And rode his hunter down.<br>
<br>
 "And with him Albert came on his.<br>
 I look'd at him with joy:<br>
 As cowslip unto oxlip is,<br>
 So seems she to the boy.<br>
<br>
 "An hour had past &shy; and, sitting straight<br>
 Within the low-wheel'd chaise,<br>
 Her mother trundled to the gate<br>
 <a name="fpsr"></a>Behind the dappled grays.<br>
<br>
 "But, as for her, she stay'd  <a href="#fps">3</a>  at home,<br>
 And on the roof she went,<br>
 And down the way you use to come,<br>
 She look'd with discontent.<br>
<br>
 "She left the novel half-uncut<br>
 Upon the rosewood shelf;<br>
 She left the new piano shut:<br>
 She could not please herself.<br>
<br>
 "Then ran she, gamesome as the colt,<br>
 And livelier than a lark<br>
 She sent her voice thro' all the holt<br>
 Before her, and the park.<br>
<br>
 "A light wind chased her on the wing,<br>
 And in the chase grew wild,<br>
 As close as might be would he cling<br>
 About the darling child:<br>
<br>
 "But light as any wind that blows<br>
 So fleetly did she stir,<br>
 The flower she touch'd on dipt and rose,<br>
 And turn'd to look at her.<br>
<br>
 "And here she came, and round me play'd,<br>
 And sang to me the whole<br>
 Of those three stanzas that you made<br>
 About my 'giant bole';<br>
<br>
 "And in a fit of frolic mirth<br>
 She strove to span my waist:<br>
 Alas, I was so broad of girth,<br>
 I could not be embraced.<br>
<br>
 "I wish'd myself the fair young beech<br>
 That here beside me stands,<br>
 That round me, clasping each in each,<br>
 She might have lock'd her hands.<br>
<br>
 "Yet seem'd the pressure thrice as sweet<br>
 As woodbine's fragile hold,<br>
 Or when I feel about my feet<br>
 The berried briony fold."<br>
<br>
 O muffle round thy knees with fern,<br>
 And shadow Sumner-chace!<br>
 Long may thy topmost branch discern<br>
 The roofs of Sumner-place!<br>
<br>
 But tell me, did she read the name<br>
 I carved with many vows<br>
 When last with throbbing heart I came<br>
 To rest beneath thy boughs?<br>
<br>
 "O yes, she wander'd round and round<br>
 These knotted knees of mine,<br>
 And found, and kiss'd the name she found,<br>
 And sweetly murmur'd thine.<br>
<br>
 "A teardrop trembled from its source,<br>
 And down my surface crept.<br>
 My sense of touch is something coarse,<br>
 But I believe she wept.<br>
<br>
 "Then flush'd her cheek with rosy light,<br>
 She glanced across the plain;<br>
 But not a creature was in sight:<br>
 She kiss'd me once again.<br>
<br>
 "Her kisses were so close and kind,<br>
 That, trust me on my word,<br>
 Hard wood I am, and wrinkled rind,<br>
 But yet my sap was stirr'd:<br>
<br>
 "And even into my inmost ring<br>
 A pleasure I discern'd<br>
 Like those blind motions of the Spring,<br>
 That show the year is turn'd.<br>
<br>
 "Thrice-happy he that may caress<br>
 The ringlet's waving balm<br>
 The cushions of whose touch may press<br>
 The maiden's tender palm.<br>
<br>
 "I, rooted here among the groves,<br>
 <a name="fptr"></a>But languidly adjust<br>
 My vapid vegetable loves  <a href="#fpt">4</a><br>
 <a name="fpur"></a>With anthers and with dust:<br>
<br>
 "For, ah! my friend, the days were brief  <a href=
"#fpu">5</a><br>
 Whereof the poets talk,<br>
 When that, which breathes within the leaf,<br>
 Could slip its bark and walk.<br>
<br>
 "But could I, as in times foregone,<br>
 From spray, and branch, and stem,<br>
 Have suck'd and gather'd into one<br>
 The life that spreads in them,<br>
<br>
 "She had not found me so remiss;<br>
 But lightly issuing thro',<br>
 I would have paid her kiss for kiss<br>
 With usury thereto."<br>
<br>
 O flourish high, with leafy towers,<br>
 And overlook the lea,<br>
 Pursue thy loves among the bowers,<br>
 But leave thou mine to me.<br>
<br>
 O flourish, hidden deep in fern,<br>
 Old oak, I love thee well;<br>
 A thousand thanks for what I learn<br>
 And what remains to tell.<br>
<br>
 "'Tis little more: the day was warm;<br>
 At last, tired out with play,<br>
 She sank her head upon her arm,<br>
 And at my feet she lay.<br>
<br>
 "Her eyelids dropp'd their silken eaves.<br>
 I breathed upon her eyes<br>
 Thro' all the summer of my leaves<br>
 A welcome mix'd with sighs.<br>
<br>
 "I took the swarming sound of life &shy;<br>
 The music from the town &shy;<br>
 The murmurs of the drum and fife<br>
 And lull'd them in my own.<br>
<br>
 "Sometimes I let a sunbeam slip,<br>
 To light her shaded eye;<br>
 A second flutter'd round her lip<br>
 Like a golden butterfly;<br>
<br>
 "A third would glimmer on her neck<br>
 To make the necklace shine;<br>
 Another slid, a sunny fleck,<br>
 From head to ancle fine.<br>
<br>
 "Then close and dark my arms I spread,<br>
 And shadow'd all her rest &shy;<br>
 Dropt dews upon her golden head,<br>
 An acorn in her breast.<br>
<br>
 "But in a pet she started up,<br>
 And pluck'd it out, and drew<br>
 My little oakling from the cup,<br>
 And flung him in the dew.<br>
<br>
 "And yet it was a graceful gift &shy;<br>
 I felt a pang within<br>
 As when I see the woodman lift<br>
 His axe to slay my kin.<br>
<br>
 "I shook him down because he was<br>
 The finest on the tree.<br>
 He lies beside thee on the grass.<br>
 O kiss him once for me.<br>
<br>
 "O kiss him twice and thrice for me,<br>
 That have no lips to kiss,<br>
 For never yet was oak on lea<br>
 Shall grow so fair as this."<br>
<br>
 Step deeper yet in herb and fern,<br>
 Look further thro' the chace,<br>
 Spread upward till thy boughs discern<br>
 The front of Sumner-place.<br>
<br>
 This fruit of thine by Love is blest,<br>
 That but a moment lay<br>
 Where fairer fruit of Love may rest<br>
 Some happy future day.<br>
<br>
 I kiss it twice, I kiss it thrice,<br>
 The warmth it thence shall win<br>
 To riper life may magnetise<br>
 The baby-oak within.<br>
<br>
 But thou, while kingdoms overset,<br>
 Or lapse from hand to hand,<br>
 Thy leaf shall never fail, nor yet<br>
 Thine acorn in the land.<br>
<br>
 May never saw dismember thee,<br>
 Nor wielded axe disjoint,<br>
 That art the fairest-spoken tree<br>
 From here to Lizard-point.<br>
<br>
 O rock upon thy towery top<br>
 All throats that gurgle sweet!<br>
 All starry culmination drop<br>
 Balm-dews to bathe thy feet!<br>
<br>
 All grass of silky feather grow &shy;<br>
 And while he sinks or swells<br>
 The full south-breeze around thee blow<br>
 The sound of minster bells.<br>
<br>
 The fat earth feed thy branchy root,<br>
 That under deeply strikes!<br>
 The northern morning o'er thee shoot<br>
 High up, in silver spikes!<br>
<br>
 Nor ever lightning char thy grain,<br>
 But, rolling as in sleep,<br>
 Low thunders bring the mellow rain,<br>
 That makes thee broad and deep!<br>
<br>
 And hear me swear a solemn oath,<br>
 That only by thy side<br>
 Will I to Olive plight my troth,<br>
 And gain her for my bride.<br>
<br>
 And when my marriage morn may fall,<br>
 She, Dryad-like, shall wear<br>
 Alternate leaf and acorn-ball<br>
 In wreath about her hair.<br>
<br>
 And I will work in prose and rhyme,<br>
 And praise thee more in both<br>
 <a name="fpvr"></a>Than bard has honour'd beech or lime,<br>
 Or that Thessalian growth,  <a href="#fpv">6</a><br>
<br>
 In which the swarthy ringdove sat,<br>
 And mystic sentence spoke;<br>
 And more than England honours that,<br>
 Thy famous brother-oak,<br>
<br>
 Wherein the younger Charles abode<br>
 Till all the paths were dim,<br>
 And far below the Roundhead rode,<br>
 And humm'd a surly hymn.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section68">Love and Duty</a></h3>

<br>
Published first in 1842.<br>
<br>
Whether this beautiful poem is autobiographical and has reference
to the compulsory separation of Tennyson and Miss Emily Sellwood,
afterwards his wife, in 1840, it is impossible for this editor to
say, as Lord Tennyson in his <i>Life</i> of his father is silent
on the subject.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>Of love that never found his earthly close,<br>
 What sequel? Streaming eyes and breaking hearts?<br>
 Or all the same as if he had not been?<br>
 <a name="fpwr"></a>Not so. Shall Error in the round of time<br>
 Still father Truth? O shall the braggart shout  <a href=
"#fpw">1</a><br>
 For some blind glimpse of freedom work itself<br>
 Thro' madness, hated by the wise, to law<br>
 System and empire? Sin itself be found<br>
 The cloudy porch oft opening on the Sun?<br>
 And only he, this wonder, dead, become<br>
 Mere highway dust? or year by year alone<br>
 Sit brooding in the ruins of a life,<br>
 Nightmare of youth, the spectre of himself!<br>
 If this were thus, if this, indeed, were all,<br>
 Better the narrow brain, the stony heart,<br>
 The staring eye glazed o'er with sapless days,<br>
 The long mechanic pacings to and fro,<br>
 The set gray life, and apathetic end.<br>
 But am I not the nobler thro' thy love?<br>
 O three times less unworthy! likewise thou<br>
 Art more thro' Love, and greater than thy years.<br>
 The Sun will run his orbit, and the Moon<br>
 Her circle. Wait, and Love himself will bring<br>
 <a name="fpxr"></a>The drooping flower of knowledge changed to
fruit<br>
 Of wisdom.  <a href="#fpx">2</a>  Wait: my faith is large in
Time,<br>
 And that which shapes it to some perfect end.<br>
 Will some one say, then why not ill for good?<br>
 Why took ye not your pastime? To that man<br>
 My work shall answer, since I knew the right<br>
 And did it; for a man is not as God,<br>
 But then most Godlike being most a man. &shy;<br>
 So let me think 'tis well for thee and me &shy;<br>
 Ill-fated that I am, what lot is mine<br>
 Whose foresight preaches peace, my heart so slow<br>
 To feel it! For how hard it seem'd to me,<br>
 When eyes, love-languid thro' half-tears, would dwell<br>
 One earnest, earnest moment upon mine,<br>
 Then not to dare to see! when thy low voice,<br>
 Faltering, would break its syllables, to keep<br>
 My own full-tuned, &shy; hold passion in a leash,<br>
 And not leap forth and fall about thy neck,<br>
 And on thy bosom, (deep-desired relief!)<br>
 Rain out the heavy mist of tears, that weigh'd<br>
 Upon my brain, my senses, and my soul!<br>
 For love himself took part against himself<br>
 To warn us off, and Duty loved of Love &shy;<br>
 O this world's curse &shy; beloved but hated &shy; came Like<br>
 Death betwixt thy dear embrace and mine,<br>
 And crying, "Who is this? behold thy bride,"<br>
 She push'd me from thee.<br>
<br>
 If the sense is hard<br>
 To alien ears, I did not speak to these &shy;<br>
 No, not to thee, but to thyself in me:<br>
 Hard is my doom and thine: thou knowest it all.<br>
 Could Love part thus? was it not well to speak,<br>
 <a name="fpyr"></a>To have spoken once? It could not but be
well.<br>
 The slow sweet hours that bring us all things good,  <a href=
"#fpy">3</a><br>
 The slow sad hours that bring us all things ill,<br>
 And all good things from evil, brought the night<br>
 In which we sat together and alone,<br>
 And to the want, that hollow'd all the heart,<br>
 Gave utterance by the yearning of an eye,<br>
 That burn'd upon its object thro' such tears<br>
 As flow but once a life. The trance gave way<br>
 To those caresses, when a hundred times<br>
 In that last kiss, which never was the last,<br>
 Farewell, like endless welcome, lived and died.<br>
 Then follow'd counsel, comfort and the words<br>
 That make a man feel strong in speaking truth;<br>
 Till now the dark was worn, and overhead<br>
 The lights of sunset and of sunrise mix'd<br>
 In that brief night; the summer night, that paused<br>
 Among her stars to hear us; stars that hung<br>
 Love-charm'd to listen: all the wheels of Time<br>
 <a name="fpzr"></a>Spun round in station, but the end had
come.<br>
 O then like those, who clench  <a href="#fpz">4</a>  their
nerves to rush<br>
 Upon their dissolution, we two rose,<br>
 There-closing like an individual life &shy;<br>
 In one blind cry of passion and of pain,<br>
 Like bitter accusation ev'n to death,<br>
 Caught up the whole of love and utter'd it,<br>
 And bade adieu for ever. Live &shy; yet live &shy;<br>
 Shall sharpest pathos blight us, knowing all<br>
 Life needs for life is possible to will &shy;<br>
 Live happy; tend thy flowers; be tended by<br>
 My blessing! Should my Shadow cross thy thoughts<br>
 <a name="fqar"></a>Too sadly for their peace, remand it thou<br>
 For calmer hours to Memory's darkest hold,  <a href=
"#fqa">5</a><br>
 If not to be forgotten &shy; not at once &shy;<br>
 Not all forgotten. Should it cross thy dreams,<br>
 O might it come like one that looks content,<br>
 With quiet eyes unfaithful to the truth,<br>
 And point thee forward to a distant light,<br>
 Or seem to lift a burthen from thy heart<br>
 And leave thee fr&euml;er, till thou wake refresh'd,<br>
 <a name="fqbr"></a>Then when the first low matin-chirp hath
grown<br>
 Full quire, and morning driv'n her plow of pearl  <a href=

<h3><a name="section69">The Golden Year</a></h3>

<br>
This poem was first published in the fourth edition of the poems
1846. No alterations were made in it after 1851. The poem had a
message for the time at which it was written. The country was in
a very troubled state. The contest between the Protectionists and
Free-traders was at its acutest stage. The Maynooth endowment and
the "godless colleges" had brought into prominence questions of
the gravest moment in religion and education, while the Corn Bill
and the Coercion Bill had inflamed the passions of party
politicians almost to madness. Tennyson, his son tells us,
entered heartily into these questions, believing that the
remedies for these distempers lay in the spread of education, a
more catholic spirit in the press, a partial adoption of Free
Trade principles, and union as far as possible among the
different sections of Christianity.<br>

<h3><a name="section70">Ulysses</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842, no alterations were made in it
subsequently.<br>
<br>
This noble poem, which is said to have induced Sir Robert Peel to
give Tennyson his pension, was written soon after Arthur Hallam's
death, presumably therefore in 1833. "It gave my feeling,"
Tennyson said to his son, "about the need of going forward and
braving the struggle of life perhaps more simply than anything in
<i>In Memoriam</i>." It is not the <i>Ulysses</i> of Homer, nor
was it suggested by the <i>Odyssey</i>. The germ, the spirit and
the sentiment of the poem are from the twenty-sixth canto of
Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, where Ulysses in the Limbo of the
Deceivers speaks from the flame which swathes him. I give a
literal version of the passage: &shy; <br>


<blockquote>"Neither fondness for my son nor reverence for my
aged sire nor the due love which ought to have gladdened Penelope
could conquer in me the ardour which I had to become experienced
in the world and in human vice and worth. I put out into the deep
open sea with but one ship and with that small company which had
not deserted me.... I and my companions were old and tardy when
we came to that narrow pass where Hercules assigned his
landmarks. 'O brothers,' I said, 'who through a hundred thousand
dangers have reached the West deny not to this the brief vigil of
your senses that remain, experience of the unpeopled world beyond
the sun. Consider your origin, ye were not formed to live like
Brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.... Night already saw
the other pole with all its stars and ours so low that it rose
not from the ocean floor'"<br>
<br>
 (<i>Inferno</i>, xxvi., 94-126).</blockquote>

<br>
 But if the germ is here the expansion is Tennyson's; he has
added elaboration and symmetry, fine touches, magical images and
magical diction. There is nothing in Dante which answers to &shy;
<br>


<blockquote>Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'<br>
 Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades<br>
 For ever and for ever when I move.</blockquote>

<br>
 or<br>


<blockquote>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br>
 It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
 And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</blockquote>

<br>
 Of these lines well does Carlyle say what so many will feel:
"These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would
till whole Lacrymatorics as I read".<br>
<br>
<br>


<blockquote>It little profits that an idle king,<br>
 By this still hearth, among these barren crags,<br>
 Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole<br>
 Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br>
 That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.<br>
 I cannot rest from travel: I will drink<br>
 Life to the lees: all times I have enjoy'd<br>
 Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those<br>
 <a name="fqgr"></a>That loved me, and alone; on shore, and
when<br>
 Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades  <a href="#fqg">1</a><br>
 Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;<br>
 For always roaming with a hungry heart<br>
 <a name="fqhr"></a>Much have I seen and known; cities of men<br>
 And manners, climates, councils, governments,  <a href=
"#fqh">2</a><br>
 Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;<br>
 And drunk delight of battle with my peers,<br>
 Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br>
 I am a part of all that I have met;<br>
 Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'<br>
 Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades<br>
 <a name="fqir"></a>For ever and for ever when I move.<br>
 How dull it is to pause, to make an end,  <a href=
"#fqi">3</a><br>
 To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!<br>
 As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life<br>
 Were all too little, and of one to me<br>
 Little remains: but every hour is saved<br>
 From that eternal silence, something more,<br>
 A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br>
 For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br>
 And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br>
 To follow knowledge, like a sinking star,<br>
 Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.<br>
 <a name="fqjr"></a><br>
 This is my son, mine own Telemachus,  <a href="#fqj">4</a><br>
 To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle &shy;<br>
 Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil<br>
 This labour, by slow prudence to make mild<br>
 A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees<br>
 Subdue them to the useful and the good.<br>
 Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere<br>
 Of common duties, decent not to fail<br>
 In offices of tenderness, and pay<br>
 Meet adoration to my household gods,<br>
 When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.<br>
 There lies the port: the vessel puffs her sail:<br>
 There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,<br>
 Souls that have toil'd and wrought, and thought with me
&shy;<br>
 That ever with a frolic welcome took<br>
 The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br>
 Free hearts, free foreheads &shy; you and I are old;<br>
 Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;<br>
 Death closes all; but something ere the end,<br>
 Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br>
 Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br>
 The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:<br>
 The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep<br>
 Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br>
 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
 Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
 The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
 To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
 Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
 <a name="fqkr"></a>It may be that the gulfs will wash us
down:<br>
 It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,  <a href=
"#fqk">5</a><br>
 And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
 Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'<br>
 We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
 Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br>
 One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
 Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
 To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</blockquote>

of the Greeks, have been identified by geographers as those
islands in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa; some take
them to mean the Canary Islands, the Madeira group and the
Azores, while they may have included the Cape de Verde Islands as
well. What seems certain is that these places with their soft
delicious climate and lovely scenery gave the poets an idea of a
happy abode for departed spirits, and so the conception of the
<i>Elysian Fields</i>. The <i>loci classici</i> on these abodes
are Homer, Odyssey, iv., 563 <i>seqq.</i>: &shy;

<blockquote><img src="TG40.gif" width="344" height="92" alt=

nor any rain, but always ocean sendeth forth the shrilly breezes
of the West to cool and refresh men.</blockquote>

and Pindar, <i>Olymp</i>., ii., 178 <i>seqq</i>., compared with
the splendid fragment at the beginning of the <i>Dirges</i>.
Elysium was afterwards placed in the netherworld, as by Virgil.
Thus, as so often the suggestion was from the facts of geography,
the rest soon became an allegorical myth, and to attempt to
identify and localise "the Happy Isles" is as great an absurdity
as to attempt to identify and localise the island of
Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i>.<br>

<h3><a name="section71">Locksley Hall</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842, and no alterations were made in it
subsequently to the edition of 1850; except that in the
Selections published in 1865 in the third stanza the reading was
"half in ruin" for "in the distance". This poem, as Tennyson
explained, was not autobiographic but purely imaginary,
"representing young life, its good side, its deficiences and its
yearnings". The poem, he added, was written in Trochaics because
the elder Hallam told him that the English people liked that
metre. The hero is a sort of preliminary sketch of the hero in
<i>Maud</i>, the position and character of each being very
similar: both are cynical and querulous, and break out into
tirades against their kind and society; both have been
disappointed in love, and both find the same remedy for their
afflictions by mixing themselves with action and becoming "one
with their kind".<br>
<br>
<i>Locksley Hall</i> was suggested, as Tennyson acknowledged, by
Sir William Jones' translation of the old Arabian
Mo&acirc;llak&acirc;t, a collection from the works of
pre-Mahommedan poets. See Sir William Jones' works, quarto
edition, vol. iv., pp. 247-57. But only one of these poems,
namely the poem of Amriolkais, could have immediately influenced
him. In this the poet supposes himself attended on a journey by a
company of friends, and they pass near a place where his mistress
had lately lived, but from which her tribe had then removed. He
desires them to stop awhile, that he may weep over the deserted
remains of her tent. They comply with his request, but exhort him
to show more strength of mind, and urge two topics of
consolation, namely, that he had before been equally unhappy and
that he had enjoyed his full share of pleasures. Thus by the
recollection of his past delights his imagination is kindled and
his grief suspended. But Tennyson's chief indebtedness is rather
in the oriental colouring given to his poem, chiefly in the
sentiment and imagery. Thus in the couplet &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Many a night I saw the Pleiads rising through the
mellow shade<br>
Glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangl'd in a silver
braid,</blockquote>

<br>
 we are reminded of "It was the hour when the Pleiads appeared in
the firmament like the folds of a silken sash variously decked
with gems".<br>
<br>
 <br>
<blockquote>Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis
early morn:<br>
 <a name="fqlr"></a>Leave me here, and when you want me, sound

<br>
 Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy
tracts,<br>
 And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.<br>
<br>
 Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,<br>
 Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.<br>
<br>
 Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow
shade,<br>
 Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver
braid.<br>
<br>
 Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime<br>
 With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of
Time;<br>
<br>
 When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;<br>
 When I clung to all the present for the promise that it
closed:<br>
<br>
 When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;<br>
 Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.

 In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
love.<br>
<br>
 Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so
young,<br>
 And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.<br>
<br>
 And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to
me,<br>
 Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee."<br>
<br>
 On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,<br>

 And she turn'd &shy; her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of
sighs &shy;<br>
 All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes
&shy;<br>
<br>
 Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me
wrong";<br>
 Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee
long".<br>

 <a name="fqor"></a>Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it
in his glowing hands;<br>
 Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.  <a

 Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with

 Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of

 Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,<br>
 And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the
Spring.<br>

 Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets

 I have but an angry fancy: what is that which I should do?<br>

 I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's
ground,<br>
 When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with
sound.<br>
<br>
 But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour
feels,<br>
 And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's
heels.<br>
<br>
 Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.<br>
 Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!<br>
<br>
 Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the
strife,<br>
 When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;<br>
<br>
 Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would
yield,<br>
 Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's
field,<br>
<br>
 <a name="fqsr"></a>And at night along the dusky highway near and
nearer drawn,<br>
 Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;
 <a href="#fqs">8</a><br>
<br>
 And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,<br>
 Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of
men;<br>
<br>
 Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something
new:<br>
 That which they have done but earnest of the things that they
shall do:<br>
<br>
 <a name="fqtr"></a>For I dipt into the future, far as human eye
could see,<br>
 Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;
 <a href="#fqt">9</a><br>
<br>
 <a name="fqur"></a> Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies
of magic sails,<br>
 Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;
 <a href="#fqu">10</a><br>
<br>
 Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly
dew<br>
 From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue; <a
href="#fqu">10</a><br>
<br>
 Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing
warm,<br>
 With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the
thunderstorm; <a href="#fqu">10</a><br>
<br>
 Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were
furl'd<br>
 In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. <a href=
"#fqu">10</a><br>
<br>
 There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in
awe,<br>
 And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.<br>
<br>
 So I triumph'd, ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me
dry,<br>
 Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced
eye;<br>
<br>
 Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of
joint,<br>
 <a name="fqvr"></a>Science moves, but slowly slowly, creeping on
from point to point:<br>
<br>
 Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,  <a
href="#fqv">11</a><br>
 Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying
fire.<br>
<br>
 Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,<br>
 And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the
suns.<br>
<br>
 What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful
joys,<br>
 Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?<br>
<br>
 Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the
shore,<br>
 And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.<br>
<br>
 Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden
breast,<br>
 Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his
rest.<br>
<br>
 Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,<br>
 They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their
scorn:<br>
<br>
 Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd
string?<br>
 I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a
thing.<br>
 <a name="fqwr"></a><br>
 Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's
pain &shy;  <a href="#fqw">12</a><br>
 Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower
brain:<br>
<br>
 Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with
mine,<br>
 Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine &shy;<br>
<br>
 Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some
retreat<br>
 Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;<br>
<br>
 Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd;
&shy;<br>
 I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.<br>
<br>
 Or to burst all links of habit &shy; there to wander far
away,<br>
 On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fqxr"></a>Larger constellations burning, mellow moons
and happy skies,<br>
 Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of

&shy;<br>
 Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.<br>
<br>
 There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of
mind,<br>
 In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake
mankind.<br>
<br>
 There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and
breathing-space;<br>
 I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.<br>

<h3><a name="section72">Godiva</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842. No alteration was made in any subsequent
edition.<br>
<br>
The poem was written in 1840 when Tennyson was returning from
Coventry to London, after his visit to Warwickshire in that year.
The Godiva pageant takes place in that town at the great fair on
Friday in Trinity week. Earl Leofric was the Lord of Coventry in
the reign of Edward the Confessor, and he and his wife Godiva
founded a magnificent Benedictine monastery at Coventry. The
first writer who mentions this legend is Matthew of Westminster,
who wrote in 1307, that is some 250 years after Leofric's time,
and what authority he had for it is not known. It is certainly
not mentioned by the many preceding writers who have left
accounts of Leofric and Godiva (see Gough's edition of Camden's
'Britannia', vol. ii., p. 346, and for a full account of the
legend see W. Reader, 'The History and Description of Coventry
Show Fair, with the History of Leofric and Godiva'). With
Tennyson's should be compared Moultrie's beautiful poem on the
same subject, and Landor's Imaginary <a name=
"G1r">Conversation</a> between Leofric and Godiva.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><a href="#G1">1</a>  <i>I waited for the train at
Coventry;<br>
 <a name="G2r">I</a> hung with grooms and porters on the
bridge,<br>
 To match the three tall spires;  <a href="#G2">2</a>  and there
I shaped<br>
 The city's ancient legend into this:</i><br>
 Not only we, the latest seed of Time,<br>
 New men, that in the flying of a wheel<br>
 Cry down the past, not only we, that prate<br>
 Of rights and wrongs, have loved the people well,<br>
 And loathed to see them overtax'd; but she<br>
 Did more, and underwent, and overcame,<br>
 The woman of a thousand summers back,<br>
 Godiva, wife to that grim Earl, who ruled<br>
 In Coventry: for when he laid a tax<br>
 Upon his town, and all the mothers brought<br>
 Their children, clamouring, "If we pay, we starve!"<br>
 She sought her lord, and found him, where he strode<br>
 About the hall, among his dogs, alone,<br>
 His beard a foot before him, and his hair<br>
 A yard behind. She told him of their tears,<br>
 And pray'd him, "If they pay this tax, they starve".<br>
 Whereat he stared, replying, half-amazed,<br>
 "You would not let your little finger ache<br>
 For such as <i>these</i>?"--"But I would die," said she.<br>
 He laugh'd, and swore by Peter and by Paul;<br>
 Then fillip'd at the diamond in her ear;<br>
 "O ay, ay, ay, you talk!"--"Alas!" she said,<br>
 "But prove me what it is I would not do."<br>
 And from a heart as rough as Esau's hand,<br>
 He answer'd, "Ride you naked thro' the town,<br>
 And I repeal it"; and nodding as in scorn,<br>
 He parted, with great strides among his dogs.<br>
 So left alone, the passions of her mind,<br>
 As winds from all the compass shift and blow,<br>
 Made war upon each other for an hour,<br>
 Till pity won. She sent a herald forth,<br>
 And bad him cry, with sound of trumpet, all<br>
 The hard condition; but that she would loose<br>
 The people: therefore, as they loved her well,<br>
 From then till noon no foot should pace the street,<br>
 No eye look down, she passing; but that all<br>
 Should keep within, door shut, and window barr'd.<br>
 Then fled she to her inmost bower, and there<br>
 Unclasp'd the wedded eagles of her belt,<br>
 The grim Earl's gift; but ever at a breath<br>
 She linger'd, looking like a summer moon<br>
 Half-dipt in cloud: anon she shook her head,<br>
 And shower'd the rippled ringlets to her knee;<br>
 Unclad herself in haste; adown the stair<br>
 Stole on; and, like a creeping sunbeam, slid<br>
 From pillar unto pillar, until she reach'd<br>
 The gateway; there she found her palfrey trapt<br>
 In purple blazon'd with armorial gold.<br>
 Then she rode forth, clothed on with chastity:<br>
 The deep air listen'd round her as she rode,<br>
 And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.<br>
 The little wide-mouth'd heads upon the spout<br>
 Had cunning eyes to see: the barking cur<br>
 Made her cheek flame: her palfrey's footfall shot<br>
 Light horrors thro' her pulses: the blind walls<br>
 Were full of chinks and holes; and overhead<br>
 Fantastic gables, crowding, stared: but she<br>
 Not less thro' all bore up, till, last, she saw<br>
 <a name="G3r">The</a> white-flower'd elder-thicket from the
field<br>
 Gleam thro' the Gothic archways  <a href="#G3">3</a>  in the
wall.<br>
 <a name="G4r">Then</a> she rode back cloth'd on with
chastity:<br>
 And one low churl,  <a href="#G4">4</a>  compact of thankless
earth,<br>
 The fatal byword of all years to come,<br>
 Boring a little auger-hole in fear,<br>
 Peep'd--but his eyes, before they had their will,<br>
 Were shrivell'd into darkness in his head,<br>
 And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait<br>
 On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misused;<br>
 And she, that knew not, pass'd: and all at once,<br>
 <a name="G5r">With</a> twelve great shocks of sound, the
shameless noon<br>
 Was clash'd and hammer'd from a hundred towers,  <a href=
"#G5">5</a><br>
 One after one: but even then she gain'd<br>
 Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crown'd,<br>
 To meet her lord, she took the tax away,<br>
 And built herself an everlasting name.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section73">The Two Voices</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842, though begun as early as 1833 and in
course of composition in 1834. See Spedding's letter dated 19th
September, 1834. Its original title was <i>The Thoughts of a
Suicide</i>. No alterations were made in the poem after 1842.<br>
<br>
It adds interest to this poem to know that it is
autobiographical. It was written soon after the death of Arthur
Hallam when Tennyson's depression was deepest. "When I wrote
<i>The Two Voices</i> I was so utterly miserable, a burden to
myself and to my family, that I said, 'Is life worth anything?'"
It is the history &shy; as Spedding put it &shy; of the
agitations, the suggestions and counter-suggestions of a mind
sunk in hopeless despondency, and meditating self-destruction,
together with the manner of its recovery to a more healthy
condition. We have two singularly interesting parallels to it in
preceding poetry. The one is in the third book of Lucretius
(830-1095), where the arguments for suicide are urged, not merely
by the poet himself, but by arguments placed by him in the mouth
of Nature herself, and urged with such cogency that they are said
to have induced one of his editors and translators, Creech, to
put an end to his life. The other is in Spenser, in the dialogue
between Despair and the Red Cross Knight, where Despair puts the
case for self-destruction, and the Red Cross Knight rebuts the
arguments (<i>Faerie Queene</i>, I. ix., st. xxxviii.-liv.).<br>
<br>


<blockquote>A still small voice spake unto me,<br>
 "Thou art so full of misery,<br>
 Were it not better not to be?"<br>
<br>
 Then to the still small voice I said;<br>
 "Let me not cast in endless shade<br>
 What is so wonderfully made".<br>
<br>
 To which the voice did urge reply;<br>
 "To-day I saw the dragon-fly<br>
 Come from the wells where he did lie.<br>
<br>
 "An inner impulse rent the veil<br>
 Of his old husk: from head to tail<br>
 Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.<br>
<br>
 "He dried his wings: like gauze they grew:<br>
 Thro' crofts and pastures wet with dew<br>
 A living flash of light he flew."<br>
<br>
 I said, "When first the world began<br>
 Young Nature thro' five cycles ran,<br>
 And in the sixth she moulded man.<br>
<br>
 "She gave him mind, the lordliest<br>
 Proportion, and, above the rest,<br>
 Dominion in the head and breast."<br>
<br>
 Thereto the silent voice replied;<br>
 "Self-blinded are you by your pride:<br>
 Look up thro' night: the world is wide.<br>
<br>
 "This truth within thy mind rehearse,<br>
 That in a boundless universe<br>
 Is boundless better, boundless worse.<br>
<br>
 "Think you this mould of hopes and fears<br>
 Could find no statelier than his peers<br>
 In yonder hundred million spheres?"<br>
<br>
 It spake, moreover, in my mind:<br>
 "Tho' thou wert scatter'd to the wind,<br>
 Yet is there plenty of the kind".<br>
<br>
 Then did my response clearer fall:<br>
 "No compound of this earthly ball<br>
 Is like another, all in all".<br>
<br>
 To which he answer'd scoffingly;<br>
 "Good soul! suppose I grant it thee,<br>
 Who'll weep for thy deficiency?<br>
 <a name="frkr"></a><br>
 "Or will one beam  <a href="#frk">1</a>  be less intense,<br>
 When thy peculiar difference<br>
 Is cancell'd in the world of sense?"<br>
<br>
 I would have said, "Thou canst not know,"<br>
 But my full heart, that work'd below,<br>
 Rain'd thro' my sight its overflow.<br>
<br>
 Again the voice spake unto me:<br>
 "Thou art so steep'd in misery,<br>
 Surely 'twere better not to be.<br>
<br>
 "Thine anguish will not let thee sleep,<br>
 Nor any train of reason keep:<br>
 Thou canst not think, but thou wilt weep."<br>
<br>
 I said, "The years with change advance:<br>
 If I make dark my countenance,<br>
 I shut my life from happier chance.<br>
<br>
 "Some turn this sickness yet might take,<br>
 Ev'n yet." But he: "What drug can make<br>
 A wither'd palsy cease to shake?"<br>
<br>
 I wept, "Tho' I should die, I know<br>
 That all about the thorn will blow<br>
 In tufts of rosy-tinted snow;<br>
<br>
 "And men, thro' novel spheres of thought<br>
 Still moving after truth long sought,<br>
 Will learn new things when I am not."<br>
<br>
 "Yet," said the secret voice, "some time,<br>
 Sooner or later, will gray prime<br>
 Make thy grass hoar with early rime.<br>
<br>
 "Not less swift souls that yearn for light,<br>
 Rapt after heaven's starry flight,<br>
 Would sweep the tracts of day and night.<br>
<br>
 "Not less the bee would range her cells,<br>
 The furzy prickle fire the dells,<br>
 The foxglove cluster dappled bells."<br>
<br>
 I said that "all the years invent;<br>
 Each month is various to present<br>
 The world with some development.<br>
<br>
 "Were this not well, to bide mine hour,<br>
 Tho' watching from a ruin'd tower<br>
 How grows the day of human power?"<br>
<br>
 "The highest-mounted mind," he said,<br>
 "Still sees the sacred morning spread<br>
 The silent summit overhead.<br>
<br>
 "Will thirty seasons render plain<br>
 Those lonely lights that still remain,<br>
 Just breaking over land and main?<br>
<br>
 "Or make that morn, from his cold crown<br>
 And crystal silence creeping down,<br>
 Flood with full daylight glebe and town?<br>
<br>
 "Forerun thy peers, thy time, and let<br>
 Thy feet, millenniums hence, be set<br>
 In midst of knowledge, dream'd not yet.<br>
<br>
 "Thou hast not gain'd a real height,<br>
 Nor art thou nearer to the light,<br>
 Because the scale is infinite.<br>
<br>
 "'Twere better not to breathe or speak,<br>
 Than cry for strength, remaining weak,<br>
 And seem to find, but still to seek.<br>
<br>
 "Moreover, but to seem to find<br>
 Asks what thou lackest, thought resign'd,<br>
 A healthy frame, a quiet mind."<br>
<br>
 I said, "When I am gone away,<br>
 'He dared not tarry,' men will say,<br>
 Doing dishonour to my clay."<br>
<br>
 "This is more vile," he made reply,<br>
 "To breathe and loathe, to live and sigh,<br>
 Than once from dread of pain to die.<br>
<br>
 "Sick art thou &shy; a divided will<br>
 Still heaping on the fear of ill<br>
 The fear of men, a coward still.<br>
<br>
 "Do men love thee? Art thou so bound<br>
 To men, that how thy name may sound<br>
 Will vex thee lying underground?<br>
<br>
 "The memory of the wither'd leaf<br>
 In endless time is scarce more brief<br>
 Than of the garner'd Autumn-sheaf.<br>
<br>
 "Go, vexed Spirit, sleep in trust;<br>
 The right ear, that is fill'd with dust,<br>
 Hears little of the false or just."<br>
<br>
 "Hard task, to pluck resolve," I cried,<br>
 "From emptiness and the waste wide<br>
 Of that abyss, or scornful pride!<br>
<br>
 "Nay &shy; rather yet that I could raise<br>
 One hope that warm'd me in the days<br>
 While still I yearn'd for human praise.<br>
<br>
 "When, wide in soul, and bold of tongue,<br>
 Among the tents I paused and sung,<br>
 The distant battle flash'd and rung.<br>
<br>
 "I sung the joyful Paean clear,<br>
 And, sitting, burnish'd without fear<br>
 The brand, the buckler, and the spear &shy;<br>
<br>
 "Waiting to strive a happy strife,<br>
 To war with falsehood to the knife,<br>
 And not to lose the good of life &shy;<br>
<br>
 "Some hidden principle to move,<br>
 To put together, part and prove,<br>
 And mete the bounds of hate and love &shy;<br>
<br>
 "As far as might be, to carve out<br>
 Free space for every human doubt,<br>
 That the whole mind might orb about &shy;<br>
<br>
 "To search thro' all I felt or saw,<br>
 The springs of life, the depths of awe,<br>
 And reach the law within the law:<br>
<br>
 "At least, not rotting like a weed,<br>
 But, having sown some generous seed,<br>
 Fruitful of further thought and deed,<br>
<br>
 "To pass, when Life her light withdraws,<br>
 Not void of righteous self-applause,<br>
 Nor in a merely selfish cause &shy;<br>
<br>
 "In some good cause, not in mine own,<br>
 To perish, wept for, honour'd, known,<br>
 And like a warrior overthrown;<br>
<br>
 "Whose eyes are dim with glorious tears,<br>
 When, soil'd with noble dust, he hears<br>
 His country's war-song thrill his ears:<br>
<br>
 "Then dying of a mortal stroke,<br>
 <a name="frlr"></a>What time the foeman's line is broke.<br>
 And all the war is roll'd in smoke."  <a href="#frl">2</a><br>
<br>
 "Yea!" said the voice, "thy dream was good,<br>
 While thou abodest in the bud.<br>
 It was the stirring of the blood.<br>
<br>
 "If Nature put not forth her power  <a href="#frl">2</a><br>
 About the opening of the flower,<br>
 Who is it that could live an hour?<br>
<br>
 "Then comes the check, the change, the fall.<br>
 Pain rises up, old pleasures pall.<br>
 There is one remedy for all.<br>
<br>
 "Yet hadst thou, thro' enduring pain,<br>
 Link'd month to month with such a chain<br>
 Of knitted purport, all were vain.<br>
<br>
 "Thou hadst not between death and birth<br>
 Dissolved the riddle of the earth.<br>
 So were thy labour little worth.<br>
<br>
 "That men with knowledge merely play'd,<br>
 I told thee &shy; hardly nigher made,<br>
 Tho' scaling slow from grade to grade;<br>
<br>
 "Much less this dreamer, deaf and blind,<br>
 Named man, may hope some truth to find,<br>
 That bears relation to the mind.<br>
<br>
 "For every worm beneath the moon<br>
 Draws different threads, and late and soon<br>
 Spins, toiling out his own cocoon.<br>
<br>
 "Cry, faint not: either Truth is born<br>
 Beyond the polar gleam forlorn,<br>
 Or in the gateways of the morn.<br>
<br>
 "Cry, faint not, climb: the summits slope<br>
 Beyond the furthest nights of hope,<br>
 Wrapt in dense cloud from base to cope.<br>
<br>
 "Sometimes a little corner shines,<br>
 As over rainy mist inclines<br>
 A gleaming crag with belts of pines.<br>
<br>
 "I will go forward, sayest thou,<br>
 I shall not fail to find her now.<br>
 Look up, the fold is on her brow.<br>
<br>
 "If straight thy track, or if oblique,<br>
 Thou know'st not. Shadows thou dost strike,<br>
 Embracing cloud, Ixion-like;<br>
<br>
 "And owning but a little more<br>
 Than beasts, abidest lame and poor,<br>
 Calling thyself a little lower<br>
<br>
 "Than angels. Cease to wail and brawl!<br>
 Why inch by inch to darkness crawl?<br>
 There is one remedy for all."<br>
<br>
 "O dull, one-sided voice," said I,<br>
 "Wilt thou make everything a lie,<br>
 To flatter me that I may die?<br>
<br>
 "I know that age to age succeeds,<br>
 Blowing a noise of tongues and deeds,<br>
 A dust of systems and of creeds.<br>
<br>
 "I cannot hide that some have striven,<br>
 Achieving calm, to whom was given<br>
 The joy that mixes man with Heaven:<br>
<br>
 "Who, rowing hard against the stream,<br>
 Saw distant gates of Eden gleam,<br>
 And did not dream it was a dream";<br>
 <a name="frmr"></a><br>
 "But heard, by secret transport led,  <a href="#frm">3</a><br>
 Ev'n in the charnels of the dead,<br>
 The murmur of the fountain-head &shy;<br>
<br>
 "Which did accomplish their desire, &shy;<br>
 Bore and forbore, and did not tire,<br>
 Like Stephen, an unquenched fire.<br>
<br>
 "He heeded not reviling tones,<br>
 Nor sold his heart to idle moans,<br>
 Tho' cursed and scorn'd, and bruised with stones:<br>
<br>
 "But looking upward, full of grace,<br>
 He pray'd, and from a happy place<br>
 God's glory smote him on the face."<br>
<br>
 The sullen answer slid betwixt:<br>
 <a name="frnr"></a>"Not that the grounds of hope were fix'd,<br>
 The elements were kindlier mix'd."  <a href="#frn">4</a><br>
<br>
 I said, "I toil beneath the curse,<br>
 <a name="fror"></a>But, knowing not the universe,<br>
 I fear to slide from bad to worse.  <a href="#fro">5</a><br>
<br>
 "And that, in seeking to undo<br>
 One riddle, and to find the true,<br>
 I knit a hundred others new:<br>
<br>
 "Or that this anguish fleeting hence,<br>
 Unmanacled from bonds of sense,<br>
 Be fix'd and froz'n to permanence:<br>
<br>
 "For I go, weak from suffering here;<br>
 Naked I go, and void of cheer:<br>
 What is it that I may not fear?"<br>
<br>
 "Consider well," the voice replied,<br>
 "His face, that two hours since hath died;<br>
 Wilt thou find passion, pain or pride?<br>
<br>
 "Will he obey when one commands?<br>
 Or answer should one press his hands?<br>
 He answers not, nor understands.<br>
<br>
 "His palms are folded on his breast:<br>
 There is no other thing express'd<br>
 But long disquiet merged in rest.<br>
<br>
 "His lips are very mild and meek:<br>
 Tho' one should smite him on the cheek,<br>
 And on the mouth, he will not speak.<br>
<br>
 "His little daughter, whose sweet face<br>
 He kiss'd, taking his last embrace,<br>
 Becomes dishonour to her race &shy;<br>
<br>
 "His sons grow up that bear his name,<br>
 <a name="frpr"></a>Some grow to honour, some to shame, &shy;<br>
 But he is chill to praise or blame.  <a href="#frp">6</a><br>
<br>
 "He will not hear the north wind rave,<br>
 Nor, moaning, household shelter crave<br>
 From winter rains that beat his grave.<br>
<br>
 "High up the vapours fold and swim:<br>
 About him broods the twilight dim:<br>
 The place he knew forgetteth him."<br>
<br>
 "If all be dark, vague voice," I said,<br>
 "These things are wrapt in doubt and dread,<br>
 Nor canst thou show the dead are dead.<br>
 <a name="frqr"></a><br>
 "The sap dries up: the plant declines.  <a href="#frq">7</a><br>
 A deeper tale my heart divines.<br>
 Know I not Death? the outward signs?<br>
<br>
 "I found him when my years were few;<br>
 A shadow on the graves I knew,<br>
 And darkness in the village yew.<br>
<br>
 "From grave to grave the shadow crept:<br>
 In her still place the morning wept:<br>
 Touch'd by his feet the daisy slept.<br>
 <a name="frrr1"></a><br>
 "The simple senses crown'd his head:  <a href="#frr1">8</a><br>
 'Omega! thou art Lord,' they<br>
 said; 'We find no motion in the dead.'<br>
<br>
 "Why, if man rot in dreamless ease,<br>
 Should that plain fact, as taught by these,<br>
 Not make him sure that he shall cease?<br>
<br>
 "Who forged that other influence,<br>
 That heat of inward evidence,<br>
 By which he doubts against the sense?<br>
 <a name="frsr"></a><br>
 "He owns the fatal gift of eyes,  <a href="#frs">9</a><br>
 That read his spirit blindly wise,<br>
 Not simple as a thing that dies.<br>
<br>
 "Here sits he shaping wings to fly:<br>
 His heart forebodes a mystery:<br>
 He names the name Eternity.<br>
<br>
 "That type of Perfect in his mind<br>
 In Nature can he nowhere find.<br>
 He sows himself in every wind.<br>
<br>
 "He seems to hear a Heavenly Friend,<br>
 And thro' thick veils to apprehend<br>
 A labour working to an end.<br>
<br>
 "The end and the beginning vex<br>
 His reason: many things perplex,<br>
 With motions, checks, and counterchecks.<br>
<br>
 "He knows a baseness in his blood<br>
 At such strange war with something good,<br>
 He may not do the thing he would.<br>
<br>
 "Heaven opens inward, chasms yawn.<br>
 Vast images in glimmering dawn,<br>
 Half shown, are broken and withdrawn.<br>
<br>
 "Ah! sure within him and without,<br>
 Could his dark wisdom find it out,<br>
 There must be answer to his doubt.<br>
<br>
 "But thou canst answer not again.<br>
 With thine own weapon art thou slain,<br>
 Or thou wilt answer but in vain.<br>
<br>
 "The doubt would rest, I dare not solve.<br>
 In the same circle we revolve.<br>
 Assurance only breeds resolve."<br>
<br>
 As when a billow, blown against,<br>
 Falls back, the voice with which I fenced<br>
 A little ceased, but recommenced.<br>
<br>
 "Where wert thou when thy father play'd<br>
 In his free field, and pastime made,<br>
 A merry boy in sun and shade?<br>
<br>
 "A merry boy they called him then.<br>
 He sat upon the knees of men<br>
 In days that never come again,<br>
<br>
 "Before the little ducts began<br>
 To feed thy bones with lime, and ran<br>
 Their course, till thou wert also man:<br>
<br>
 "Who took a wife, who rear'd his race,<br>
 Whose wrinkles gather'd on his face,<br>
 Whose troubles number with his days:<br>
<br>
 "A life of nothings, nothing-worth,<br>
 From that first nothing ere his birth<br>
 To that last nothing under earth!"<br>
<br>
 "These words," I said, "are like the rest,<br>
 No certain clearness, but at best<br>
 A vague suspicion of the breast:<br>
<br>
 "But if I grant, thou might'st defend<br>
 The thesis which thy words intend &shy;<br>
 That to begin implies to end;<br>
 <a name="frtr"></a><br>
 "Yet how should I for certain hold,  <a href="#frt">10</a><br>
 Because my memory is so cold,<br>
 That I first was in human mould?<br>
<br>
 "I cannot make this matter plain,<br>
 But I would shoot, howe'er in vain,<br>
 A random arrow from the brain.<br>
<br>
 "It may be that no life is found,<br>
 Which only to one engine bound<br>
 Falls off, but cycles always round.<br>
<br>
 "As old mythologies relate,<br>
 Some draught of Lethe might await<br>
 The slipping thro' from state to state.<br>
<br>
 "As here we find in trances, men<br>
 Forget the dream that happens then,<br>
 Until they fall in trance again.<br>
<br>
 "So might we, if our state were such<br>
 <a name="frur"></a>As one before, remember much,<br>
 For those two likes might meet and touch.  <a href=
"#fru">11</a><br>
<br>
 "But, if I lapsed from nobler place,<br>
 Some legend of a fallen race<br>
 Alone might hint of my disgrace;<br>
<br>
 "Some vague emotion of delight<br>
 In gazing up an Alpine height,<br>
 Some yearning toward the lamps of night.<br>
<br>
 "Or if thro' lower lives I came &shy;<br>
 Tho' all experience past became<br>
 Consolidate in mind and frame &shy;<br>
<br>
 "I might forget my weaker lot;<br>
 For is not our first year forgot?<br>
 The haunts of memory echo not.<br>
<br>
 <a name="frvr"></a>"And men, whose reason long was blind,<br>
 From cells of madness unconfined,  <a href="#frv">12</a><br>
 Oft lose whole years of darker mind.<br>
<br>
 "Much more, if first I floated free,<br>
 As naked essence, must I be<br>
 Incompetent of memory:<br>
<br>
 "For memory dealing but with time,<br>
 And he with matter, could she climb<br>
 Beyond her own material prime?<br>
<br>
 "Moreover, something is or seems,<br>
 That touches me with mystic gleams,<br>
 Like glimpses of forgotten dreams &shy;<br>
<br>
 "Of something felt, like something here;<br>
 Of something done, I know not where;<br>
 Such as no language may declare."<br>
<br>
 The still voice laugh'd. "I talk," said he,<br>
 "Not with thy dreams.<br>
 Suffice it thee Thy pain is a reality."<br>
<br>
 "But thou," said I, "hast miss'd thy mark,<br>
 Who sought'st to wreck my mortal ark,<br>
 By making all the horizon dark.<br>
<br>
 "Why not set forth, if I should do<br>
 This rashness, that which might ensue<br>
 With this old soul in organs new?<br>
<br>
 "Whatever crazy sorrow saith,<br>
 No life that breathes with human breath<br>
 Has ever truly long'd for death.<br>
<br>
 "'Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant,<br>
 Oh life, not death, for which we pant;<br>
 More life, and fuller, that I want."<br>
<br>
 I ceased, and sat as one forlorn.<br>
 Then said the voice, in quiet scorn,<br>
 "Behold it is the Sabbath morn".<br>
<br>
 And I arose, and I released<br>
 The casement, and the light increased<br>
 With freshness in the dawning east.<br>
<br>
 Like soften'd airs that blowing steal,<br>
 When meres begin to uncongeal,<br>
 The sweet church bells began to peal.<br>
<br>
 On to God's house the people prest:<br>
 Passing the place where each must rest,<br>
 Each enter'd like a welcome guest.<br>
<br>
 One walk'd between his wife and child,<br>
 With measur'd footfall firm and mild,<br>
 And now and then he gravely smiled.<br>
<br>
 <a name="frwr"></a>The prudent partner of his blood<br>
 Lean'd on him, faithful, gentle, good,  <a href=
"#frw">13</a><br>
 Wearing the rose of womanhood.<br>
<br>
 And in their double love secure,<br>
 The little maiden walk'd demure,<br>
 Pacing with downward eyelids pure.<br>
<br>
 These three made unity so sweet,<br>
 My frozen heart began to beat,<br>
 Remembering its ancient heat.<br>
<br>
 I blest them, and they wander'd on:<br>
 I spoke, but answer came there none:<br>
 The dull and bitter voice was gone.<br>
<br>
 A second voice was at mine ear,<br>
 A little whisper silver-clear,<br>
 A murmur, "Be of better cheer".<br>
<br>
 As from some blissful neighbourhood,<br>
 A notice faintly understood,<br>
 "I see the end, and know the good".<br>
<br>
 A little hint to solace woe,<br>
 A hint, a whisper breathing low,<br>
 "I may not speak of what I know".<br>
<br>
 Like an Aeolian harp that wakes<br>
 No certain air, but overtakes<br>
 Far thought with music that it makes:<br>
<br>
 Such seem'd the whisper at my side:<br>
 "What is it thou knowest, sweet voice?" I cried.<br>
 "A hidden hope," the voice replied:<br>
<br>
 So heavenly-toned, that in that hour<br>
 From out my sullen heart a power<br>
 Broke, like the rainbow from the shower,<br>
<br>
 To feel, altho' no tongue can prove<br>
 That every cloud, that spreads above<br>
 And veileth love, itself is love.<br>
<br>
 And forth into the fields I went,<br>
 And Nature's living motion lent<br>
 The pulse of hope to discontent.<br>
<br>
 I wonder'd at the bounteous hours,<br>
 The slow result of winter showers:<br>
 You scarce could see the grass for flowers.<br>
<br>
 I wonder'd, while I paced along:<br>
 The woods were fill'd so full with song,<br>
 There seem'd no room for sense of wrong.<br>
 <a name="frxr"></a><br>
 So variously seem'd all things wrought,  <a href=
"#frx">14</a><br>
 I marvell'd how the mind was brought<br>
 To anchor by one gloomy thought;<br>
<br>
 And wherefore rather I made choice<br>
 To commune with that barren voice,<br>
 Than him that said, "Rejoice! rejoice!"</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section74">The Day-Dream</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842, but written in 1835. In it is
incorporated, though with several alterations, <i>The Sleeping
Beauty</i>, published among the poems of 1830, but excised in
subsequent editions. Half extravaganza and half apologue, like
the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, this delightful poem may be
safely left to deliver its own message and convey its own
meaning. It is an excellent illustration of the truth of
Tennyson's own remark: "Poetry is like shot silk with many
glancing colours. Every reader must find his own interpretation
according to his ability, and according to his sympathy with the
poet."<br>
<br>
<b>Prologue</b> (No alteration has been made in the Prologue
since 1842).<br>
<br>


<blockquote>O, Lady Flora, let me speak:<br>
 A pleasant hour has past away<br>
 While, dreaming on your damask cheek,<br>
 The dewy sister-eyelids lay.<br>
<br>
 As by the lattice you reclined,<br>
 I went thro' many wayward moods<br>
 To see you dreaming &shy; and, behind,<br>
 A summer crisp with shining woods.<br>
 And I too dream'd, until at last<br>
 Across my fancy, brooding warm,<br>
 The reflex of a legend past,<br>
 And loosely settled into form.<br>
 And would you have the thought I had,<br>
 And see the vision that I saw,<br>
 Then take the broidery-frame, and add<br>
 A crimson to the quaint Macaw,<br>
 And I will tell it. Turn your face,<br>
 Nor look with that too-earnest eye &shy;<br>
 The rhymes are dazzled from their place,<br>
 And order'd words asunder fly.</blockquote>

<br>
First published in 1842. No alteration since 1850.<br>
<br>
 <br>
In this humorous allegory the poet bewails his unhappy lot on
having fallen on an age so unpropitious to poetry, contrasting it
with the happy times so responsive to his predecessors who piped
to a world prepared to dance to their music. However, he must
toil and be satisfied if he can make a little garden blossom.<br>


<blockquote>My father left a park to me,<br>
 But it is wild and barren,<br>
 A garden too with scarce a tree<br>
 And waster than a warren:<br>
 Yet say the neighbours when they call,<br>
 It is not bad but good land,<br>
 And in it is the germ of all<br>
 That grows within the woodland.<br>
<br>
 <a name="fslr"></a>O had I lived when song was great<br>
 In days of old Amphion,  <a href="#fsl">1</a><br>
 And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,<br>
 Nor cared for seed or scion!<br>
 And had I lived when song was great,<br>
 And legs of trees were limber,<br>
 And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,<br>
 And fiddled in the timber!<br>
<br>
 'Tis said he had a tuneful tongue,<br>
 Such happy intonation,<br>
 Wherever he sat down and sung<br>
 He left a small plantation;<br>
 Wherever in a lonely grove<br>
 He set up his forlorn pipes,<br>
 The gouty oak began to move,<br>
 And flounder into hornpipes.<br>
<br>
 The mountain stirr'd its bushy crown,<br>
 And, as tradition teaches,<br>
 Young ashes pirouetted down<br>
 Coquetting with young beeches;<br>
 And briony-vine and ivy-wreath<br>
 Ran forward to his rhyming,<br>
 And from the valleys underneath<br>
 Came little copses climbing.<br>
<br>
 The linden broke her ranks and rent<br>
 The woodbine wreathes that bind her,<br>
 <a name="fsmr"></a>And down the middle, buzz! she went,<br>
 With all her bees behind her.  <a href="#fsm">2</a><br>
 The poplars, in long order due,<br>
 With cypress promenaded,<br>
 The shock-head willows two and two<br>
 By rivers gallopaded.<br>
<br>
 The birch-tree swang her fragrant hair,<br>
 The bramble cast her berry,<br>
 The gin within the juniper<br>
 Began to make him merry.<br>
<br>
 Came wet-shot alder from the wave,<br>
 Came yews, a dismal coterie;<br>
 Each pluck'd his one foot from the grave,<br>
 Poussetting with a sloe-tree:<br>
 Old elms came breaking from the vine,<br>
 The vine stream'd out to follow,<br>
 And, sweating rosin, plump'd the pine<br>
 From many a cloudy hollow.<br>
<br>
 And wasn't it a sight to see<br>
 When, ere his song was ended,<br>
 Like some great landslip, tree by tree,<br>
 The country-side descended;<br>
 And shepherds from the mountain-caves<br>
 Look'd down, half-pleased, half-frighten'd,<br>
 As dash'd about the drunken leaves<br>
 The random sunshine lighten'd!<br>
<br>
 Oh, nature first was fresh to men,<br>
 And wanton without measure;<br>
 So youthful and so flexile then,<br>
 You moved her at your pleasure.<br>
 Twang out, my fiddle! shake the twigs!<br>
 And make her dance attendance;<br>
 Blow, flute, and stir the stiff-set sprigs,<br>
 And scirrhous roots and tendons.<br>
<br>
 'Tis vain! in such a brassy age<br>
 I could not move a thistle;<br>
 The very sparrows in the hedge<br>
 Scarce answer to my whistle;<br>
 Or at the most, when three-parts-sick<br>
 With strumming and with scraping,<br>
 A jackass heehaws from the rick,<br>
 The passive oxen gaping.<br>
<br>

 Like sleepy counsel pleading:<br>
 O Lord! &shy; 'tis in my neighbour's ground,<br>
 The modern Muses reading.<br>
 They read Botanic Treatises.<br>

 And Methods of transplanting trees<br>
 To look as if they grew there.<br>
<br>
 The wither'd Misses! how they prose<br>
 O'er books of travell'd seamen,<br>
 And show you slips of all that grows<br>
 From England to Van Diemen.<br>
 They read in arbours clipt and cut,<br>
 And alleys, faded places,<br>
 By squares of tropic summer shut<br>
 And warm'd in crystal cases.<br>
<br>
 But these, tho' fed with careful dirt,<br>
 Are neither green nor sappy;<br>

 Better to me the meanest weed<br>
 That blows upon its mountain,<br>
 The vilest herb that runs to seed<br>
 Beside its native fountain.<br>

 And I must work thro' months of toil,<br>
 And years of cultivation,<br>
 Upon my proper patch of soil<br>
 To grow my own plantation.<br>
 I'll take the showers as they fall,<br>
 I will not vex my bosom:<br>
 Enough if at the end of all<br>
 A little garden blossom.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section83">St. Agnes</a></h3>

<br>
 This exquisite little poem was first published in 1837 in the
<i>Keepsake</i>, an annual edited by Lady Emmeline Stuart
Wortley, and was included in the edition of 1842. No alteration
has been made in it since 1842.<br>
<br>
In 1857 the title was altered from "St. Agnes" to "St. Agnes'
Eve," thus bringing it near to Keats' poem, which certainly
influenced Tennyson in writing it, as a comparison of the opening
of the two poems will show. The saint from whom the poem takes
its name was a young girl of thirteen who suffered martyrdom in
the reign of Diocletian: she is a companion to Sir Galahad.<br>
<br>


<blockquote><br>
 Deep on the convent-roof the snows<br>
 Are sparkling to the moon:<br>
 My breath to heaven like vapour goes:<br>
 May my soul follow soon!<br>
 The shadows of the convent-towers<br>
 Slant down the snowy sward,<br>
 Still creeping with the creeping hours<br>
 <a name="fsor"></a>That lead me to my Lord:<br>
 Make Thou  <a href="#fso">1</a>  my spirit pure and clear<br>
 As are the frosty skies,<br>
 <a name="fspr"></a>Or this first snowdrop of the year<br>
 That in  <a href="#fsp">2</a>  my bosom lies.<br>
<br>
 As these white robes are soiled and dark,<br>
 To yonder shining ground;<br>
 As this pale taper's earthly spark,<br>
 To yonder argent round;<br>
 So shows my soul before the Lamb,<br>
 My spirit before Thee;<br>
 So in mine earthly house I am,<br>
 To that I hope to be.<br>
 Break up the heavens, O Lord! and far,<br>
 Thro' all yon starlight keen,<br>
 Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star,<br>
 In raiment white and clean.<br>

<h3><a name="section84">Sir Galahad</a></h3>

<br>
Published in 1842. No alteration has been made in it since. This
poem may be regarded as a prelude to <i>The Holy Grail</i>. The
character of Galahad is deduced principally from the seventeenth
book of the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>. In the twenty-second chapter
of that book St. Joseph of Arimathea says to him: "Thou hast
resembled me in two things in that thou hast seen the marvels of
the sangreal, and in that thou has been a clean maiden".<br>
<br>


<blockquote>My good blade carves the casques of men,<br>
 My tough lance thrusteth sure,<br>
 My strength is as the strength of ten,<br>
 Because my heart is pure.<br>
<br>
 The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,<br>
 The hard brands shiver on the steel,<br>
 The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,<br>
 The horse and rider reel:<br>
<br>
 They reel, they roll in clanging lists,<br>
 And when the tide of combat stands,<br>
 Perfume and flowers fall in showers,<br>
 That lightly rain from ladies' hands.<br>
<br>
 How sweet are looks that ladies bend<br>
 On whom their favours fall!<br>
 For them I battle till the end,<br>
 To save from shame and thrall:<br>
 But all my heart is drawn above,<br>
 My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine:<br>
 I never felt the kiss of love,<br>
 Nor maiden's hand in mine.<br>
 More bounteous aspects on me beam,<br>
 Me mightier transports move and thrill;<br>
 So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer<br>
 A virgin heart in work and will.<br>
<br>
 When down the stormy crescent goes,<br>
 A light before me swims,<br>
 Between dark stems the forest glows,<br>
 I hear a noise of hymns:<br>
 Then by some secret shrine I ride;<br>
 I hear a voice, but none are there;<br>
 The stalls are void, the doors are wide,<br>
 The tapers burning fair.<br>
 Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,<br>
 The silver vessels sparkle clean,<br>
 The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,<br>
 And solemn chaunts resound between.<br>
<br>
 Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres<br>
 I find a magic bark;<br>
 I leap on board: no helmsman steers:<br>
 I float till all is dark.<br>
 A gentle sound, an awful light!<br>
 Three angels bear the holy Grail:<br>
 With folded feet, in stoles of white,<br>
 On sleeping wings they sail.<br>
 Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!<br>
 My spirit beats her mortal bars,<br>
 As down dark tides the glory slides,<br>
 And star-like mingles with the stars.<br>
<br>
 When on my goodly charger borne<br>
 Thro' dreaming towns I go,<br>
 The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,<br>
 The streets are dumb with snow.<br>
 The tempest crackles on the leads,<br>
 And, ringing, spins from brand and mail;<br>
 But o'er the dark a glory spreads,<br>
 And gilds the driving hail.<br>
 I leave the plain, I climb the height;<br>
 No branchy thicket shelter yields;<br>
 But blessed forms in whistling storms<br>
 Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.<br>
<br>
 A maiden knight &shy; to me is given<br>
 Such hope, I know not fear;<br>
 I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven<br>
 That often meet me here.<br>
 I muse on joy that will not cease,<br>
 Pure spaces clothed in living beams,<br>
 Pure lilies of eternal peace,<br>
 Whose odours haunt my dreams;<br>
 And, stricken by an angel's hand,<br>
 This mortal armour that I wear,<br>
 This weight and size, this heart and eyes,<br>
 Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air.<br>
<br>
 The clouds are broken in the sky,<br>
 And thro' the mountain-walls<br>
 A rolling organ-harmony<br>
 Swells up, and shakes and falls.<br>
 Then move the trees, the copses nod,<br>
 Wings flutter, voices hover clear:<br>
 "O just and faithful knight of God!<br>
 Ride on! the prize is near".<br>
 So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;<br>
 By bridge and ford, by park and pale,<br>
 All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,<br>
 Until I find the holy Grail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sweet Emma Moreland of yonder town<br>
 Met me walking on yonder way,<br>
 "And have you lost your heart?" she said;<br>
 "And are you married yet, Edward Gray?"<br>

 On the mossy stone, as I lay,<br>
 'Here lies the body of Ellen Adair;<br>
 And here the heart of Edward Gray!'<br>
<br>
 "Love may come, and love may go,<br>
 And fly, like a bird, from tree to tree:<br>
 But I will love no more, no more,<br>
 Till Ellen Adair come back to me.<br>

 Bitterly weeping I turn'd away;<br>

<h3><a name="section86">Will Waterproof's Lyrical
Monologue</a></h3>

<br>
<b>made at The Cock.</b><br>
<br>
First published 1842. The final text was that of 1853, which has
not been altered since, except that in stanza 29 the two "we's"
in the first line and the "thy" in the third line are not in
later editions italicised. The Cock Tavern, No. 201 Fleet Street,
on the north side of Fleet Street, stood opposite the Temple and
was of great antiquity, going back nearly 300 years. Strype, bk.
iv., h. 117, describes it as "a noted public-house," and Pepys'
<i>Diary</i>, 23rd April, 1668, speaks of himself as having been
"mighty merry there". The old carved chimney-piece was of the age
of James I., and the gilt bird over the portal was the work of
Grinling Gibbons. When Tennyson wrote this poem it was the
favourite resort of templars, journalists and literary people
generally, as it had long been. But the old place is now a thing
of the past. On the evening of 10th April, 1886, it closed its
doors for ever after an existence of nearly 300 years. There is
an admirable description of it, signed A. J. M., in <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, seventh series, vol. i., 442-6. I give a short
extract: <br>


<blockquote>"At the end of a long room beyond the skylight which,
except a feeble side window, was its only light in the daytime,
was a door that led past a small lavatory and up half a dozen
narrow steps to the kitchen, one of the strangest and grimmest
old kitchens you ever saw. Across a mighty hatch, thronged with
dishes, you looked into it and beheld there the white-jacketed
man-cook, served by his two robust and red-armed kitchen maids.
For you they were preparing chops, pork chops in winter, lamb
chops in spring, mutton chops always, and steaks and sausages,
and kidneys and potatoes, and poached eggs and Welsh rabbits, and
stewed cheese, the special glory of the house. That was the
<i>menu</i> and men were the only guests. But of late years, as
innovations often precede a catastrophe, two new things were
introduced, vegetables and women. Both were respectable and both
were good, but it was felt, especially by the virtuous
Smurthwaite, that they were <i>de trop</i> in a place so
masculine and so carnivorous."</blockquote>

<blockquote>O plump head-waiter at The Cock,<br>
 To which I most resort,<br>
 How goes the time? 'Tis five o'clock.<br>
 Go fetch a pint of port:<br>
 But let it not be such as that<br>
 You set before chance-comers,<br>
 But such whose father-grape grew fat<br>
 On Lusitanian summers.<br>
<br>
 No vain libation to the Muse,<br>
 But may she still be kind,<br>
 And whisper lovely words, and use<br>
 Her influence on the mind,<br>
 To make me write my random rhymes,<br>
 Ere they be half-forgotten;<br>
 Nor add and alter, many times,<br>
 Till all be ripe and rotten.<br>
<br>
 I pledge her, and she comes and dips<br>
 Her laurel in the wine,<br>
 And lays it thrice upon my lips,<br>
 These favour'd lips of mine;<br>
 Until the charm have power to make<br>
 New life-blood warm the bosom,<br>
 <a name="fsur"></a>And barren commonplaces break<br>
 In full and kindly  <a href="#fsu">1</a> blossom.<br>
<br>
 I pledge her silent at the board;<br>
 Her gradual fingers steal<br>
 And touch upon the master-chord<br>
 Of all I felt and feel.<br>
 Old wishes, ghosts of broken plans,<br>
 And phantom hopes assemble;<br>
 And that child's heart within the man's<br>
 Begins to move and tremble.<br>
<br>
 Thro' many an hour of summer suns<br>
 By many pleasant ways,<br>
 <a name="fsvr"></a>Against its fountain upward runs<br>
 The current of my days:  <a href="#fsv">2</a><br>
 I kiss the lips I once have kiss'd;<br>
 The gas-light wavers dimmer;<br>
 And softly, thro' a vinous mist,<br>
 My college friendships glimmer.<br>
<br>
 I grow in worth, and wit, and sense,<br>
 Unboding critic-pen,<br>
 Or that eternal want of pence,<br>
 Which vexes public men,<br>
 Who hold their hands to all, and cry<br>
 For that which all deny them &shy;<br>
 Who sweep the crossings, wet or dry,<br>
 And all the world go by them.<br>
 <a name="fswr"></a><br>
 Ah yet, tho'  <a href="#fsw">3</a>  all the world forsake,<br>
 Tho'  <a href="#fsw">3</a>  fortune clip my wings,<br>
 I will not cramp my heart, nor take<br>
 Half-views of men and things.<br>
 Let Whig and Tory stir their blood;<br>
 There must be stormy weather;<br>
 But for some true result of good<br>
 All parties work together.<br>
<br>
 Let there be thistles, there are grapes;<br>
 If old things, there are new;<br>
 Ten thousand broken lights and shapes,<br>
 Yet glimpses of the true.<br>
 Let raffs be rife in prose and rhyme,<br>
 <a name="fsxr"></a>We lack not rhymes and reasons,<br>
 As on this whirligig of Time  <a href="#fsx">4</a><br>
 We circle with the seasons.<br>
<br>
 This earth is rich in man and maid;<br>
 With fair horizons bound:<br>
 This whole wide earth of light and shade<br>
 Comes out, a perfect round.<br>
 High over roaring Temple-bar,<br>
 And, set in Heaven's third story,<br>
 I look at all things as they are,<br>
 But thro' a kind of glory.<br>
<br>
 Head-waiter, honour'd by the guest<br>
 Half-mused, or reeling-ripe,<br>
 The pint, you brought me, was the best<br>
 <a name="fswr2"></a>That ever came from pipe.<br>
 But tho'  <a href="#fsw">3</a>  the port surpasses praise,<br>
 My nerves have dealt with stiffer.<br>
 Is there some magic in the place?<br>
 Or do my peptics differ?<br>
<br>
 For since I came to live and learn,<br>
 No pint of white or red<br>
 Had ever half the power to turn<br>
 This wheel within my head,<br>
<br>
 Which bears a season'd brain about,<br>
 Unsubject to confusion,<br>
 Tho'  <a href="#fsw">3</a>  soak'd and saturate, out and
out,<br>
 Thro' every convolution.<br>
<br>
 For I am of a numerous house,<br>
 With many kinsmen gay,<br>
 Where long and largely we carouse<br>
 As who shall say me nay:<br>
 Each month, a birthday coming on,<br>
 We drink defying trouble,<br>
 Or sometimes two would meet in one,<br>
 And then we drank it double;<br>
<br>
 Whether the vintage, yet unkept,<br>
 Had relish, fiery-new,<br>
 Or, elbow-deep in sawdust, slept,<br>
 As old as Waterloo;<br>
 Or stow'd (when classic Canning died)<br>
 In musty bins and chambers,<br>
 Had cast upon its crusty side<br>
 The gloom of ten Decembers.<br>
<br>
 The Muse, the jolly Muse, it is!<br>
 She answer'd to my call,<br>
 She changes with that mood or this,<br>
 Is all-in-all to all:<br>
 She lit the spark within my throat,<br>
 To make my blood run quicker,<br>
 Used all her fiery will, and smote<br>
 Her life into the liquor.<br>
<br>
 And hence this halo lives about<br>
 The waiter's hands, that reach<br>
 To each his perfect pint of stout,<br>
 His proper chop to each.<br>
 He looks not like the common breed<br>
 That with the napkin dally;<br>
 I think he came like Ganymede,<br>
 From some delightful valley.<br>
<br>
 The Cock was of a larger egg<br>
 Than modern poultry drop,<br>
 Stept forward on a firmer leg,<br>
 And cramm'd a plumper crop;<br>
 Upon an ampler dunghill trod,<br>
 Crow'd lustier late and early,<br>
 Sipt wine from silver, praising God,<br>
 And raked in golden barley.<br>
<br>
 A private life was all his joy,<br>
 Till in a court he saw<br>
 A something-pottle-bodied boy,<br>
 That knuckled at the taw:<br>
 He stoop'd and clutch'd him, fair and good,<br>
 Flew over roof and casement:<br>
 His brothers of the weather stood<br>
 Stock-still for sheer amazement.<br>
<br>
 But he, by farmstead, thorpe and spire,<br>
 And follow'd with acclaims,<br>
 A sign to many a staring shire,<br>
 Came crowing over Thames.<br>
 <a name="fsyr"></a>Right down by smoky Paul's they bore,<br>
 Till, where the street grows straiter,  <a href="#fsy">5</a><br>
 One fix'd for ever at the door,<br>
 And one became head-waiter.<br>
<br>
 But whither would my fancy go?<br>
 How out of place she makes<br>
 The violet of a legend blow<br>
 Among the chops and steaks!<br>
 'Tis but a steward of the can,<br>
 One shade more plump than common;<br>
 As just and mere a serving-man<br>
 As any born of woman.<br>
<br>
 I ranged too high: what draws me down<br>
 Into the common day?<br>
 Is it the weight of that half-crown,<br>
 Which I shall have to pay?<br>
<br>
 For, something duller than at first,<br>
 Nor wholly comfortable,<br>
 I sit (my empty glass reversed),<br>
 And thrumming on the table:<br>
<br>
 Half-fearful that, with self at strife<br>
 I take myself to task;<br>
 Lest of the fullness of my life<br>
 I leave an empty flask:<br>
 For I had hope, by something rare,<br>
 To prove myself a poet;<br>
 But, while I plan and plan, my hair<br>
 Is gray before I know it.<br>
<br>
 So fares it since the years began,<br>
 Till they be gather'd up;<br>
 The truth, that flies the flowing can,<br>
 Will haunt the vacant cup:<br>
 And others' follies teach us not,<br>
 Nor much their wisdom teaches;<br>
 And most, of sterling worth, is what<br>
 Our own experience preaches.<br>
<br>
 Ah, let the rusty theme alone!<br>
 We know not what we know.<br>
 But for my pleasant hour, 'tis gone,<br>
 'Tis gone, and let it go.<br>
 'Tis gone: a thousand such have slipt<br>
 Away from my embraces,<br>
 And fall'n into the dusty crypt<br>
 Of darken'd forms and faces.<br>
<br>
 Go, therefore, thou! thy betters went<br>
 Long since, and came no more;<br>
 With peals of genial clamour sent<br>
 From many a tavern-door,<br>
 With twisted quirks and happy hits,<br>
 From misty men of letters;<br>
 The tavern-hours of mighty wits &shy;<br>
 Thine elders and thy betters.<br>
<br>
 Hours, when the Poet's words and looks<br>
 Had yet their native glow:<br>
 Not yet the fear of little books<br>
 Had made him talk for show:<br>
 But, all his vast heart sherris-warm'd,<br>
 He flash'd his random speeches;<br>
 Ere days, that deal in ana, swarm'd<br>
 His literary leeches.<br>
<br>
 So mix for ever with the past,<br>
 Like all good things on earth!<br>
 For should I prize thee, couldst thou last,<br>
 At half thy real worth?<br>
 I hold it good, good things should pass:<br>
 With time I will not quarrel:<br>
 It is but yonder empty glass<br>
 That makes me maudlin-moral.<br>
<br>
 Head-waiter of the chop-house here,<br>
 To which I most resort,<br>
 I too must part: I hold thee dear<br>
 For this good pint of port.<br>
 For this, thou shalt from all things suck<br>
 Marrow of mirth and laughter;<br>
 And, wheresoe'er thou move, good luck<br>
 Shall fling her old shoe after.<br>
<br>
 But thou wilt never move from hence,<br>
 The sphere thy fate allots:<br>
 Thy latter days increased with pence<br>
 Go down among the pots:<br>
 Thou battenest by the greasy gleam<br>
 In haunts of hungry sinners,<br>
 Old boxes, larded with the steam<br>
 Of thirty thousand dinners.<br>
<br>
 <i>We</i> fret, <i>we</i> fume, would shift our skins,<br>
 Would quarrel with our lot;<br>
 <i>Thy</i> care is, under polish'd tins,<br>
 To serve the hot-and-hot;<br>
 To come and go, and come again,<br>
 Returning like the pewit,<br>
 And watch'd by silent gentlemen,<br>
 That trifle with the cruet.<br>
<br>
 Live long, ere from thy topmost head<br>
 The thick-set hazel dies;<br>
 Long, ere the hateful crow shall tread<br>
 The corners of thine eyes:<br>
 Live long, nor feel in head or chest<br>
 Our changeful equinoxes,<br>
 Till mellow Death, like some late guest,<br>
 Shall call thee from the boxes.<br>
<br>
 But when he calls, and thou shalt cease<br>
 To pace the gritted floor,<br>
 And, laying down an unctuous lease<br>
 Of life, shalt earn no more;<br>
 No carved cross-bones, the types of Death,<br>
 Shall show thee past to Heaven:<br>
 But carved cross-pipes, and, underneath,<br>
 A pint-pot neatly graven.</blockquote>

<b>after reading a Life and Letters</b><br>
<br>
Originally published in the <i>Examiner</i> for 24th March, 1849;
then in the sixth edition of the poems, 1850, with the second
part of the title and the alterations noted. When reprinted in
1851 one more slight alteration was made. It has not been altered
since. The work referred to was Moncton Milne's (afterwards Lord
Houghton) <i>Letters and Literary Remains of Keats</i> published
in 1848, and the person to whom the poem may have been addressed
was Tennyson's brother Charles, afterwards Charles Tennyson
Turner, to the facts of whose life and to whose character it
would exactly apply. See Napier,<i>Homes and Haunts of
Tennyson</i>, 48-50. But Sir Franklin Lushington tells me that it
was most probably addressed to some imaginary person, as neither
he nor such of Tennyson's surviving friends as he kindly
consulted for me are able to identify the person.<br>

<blockquote>You might have won the Poet's name<br>
 If such be worth the winning now,<br>
 And gain'd a laurel for your brow<br>
 Of sounder leaf than I can claim;<br>
 But you have made the wiser choice,<br>
 A life that moves to gracious ends<br>
 Thro' troops of unrecording friends,<br>
 A deedful life, a silent voice:<br>
<br>
 And you have miss'd the irreverent doom<br>
 Of those that wear the Poet's crown:<br>
 Hereafter, neither knave nor clown<br>
 Shall hold their orgies at your tomb.<br>
<br>
 For now the Poet cannot die<br>
 Nor leave his music as of old,<br>
 But round him ere he scarce be cold<br>
 Begins the scandal and the cry:<br>
<br>
 "Proclaim the faults he would not show:<br>
 Break lock and seal: betray the trust:<br>
 Keep nothing sacred: 'tis but just<br>
 The many-headed beast should know".<br>
<br>
 Ah, shameless! for he did but sing.<br>
 A song that pleased us from its worth;<br>
 No public life was his on earth,<br>
 No blazon'd statesman he, nor king.<br>

<h3><a name="section89">Lady Clare</a></h3>

<br>
First published 1842. After 1851 no alterations were made.<br>
<br>
This poem was suggested by Miss Ferrier's powerful novel <i>The
Inheritance</i>. A comparison with the plot of Miss Ferrier's
novel will show with what tact and skill Tennyson has adapted the
tale to his ballad. Thomas St. Clair, youngest son of the Earl of
Rossville, marries a Miss Sarah Black, a girl of humble and
obscure birth. He dies, leaving a widow and as is supposed a
daughter, Gertrude, who claim the protection of Lord Rossville,
as the child is heiress presumptive to the earldom. On Lord
Rossville's death she accordingly becomes Countess of Rossville.
She has two lovers, both distant connections, Colonel Delmour and
Edward Lyndsay. At last it is discovered that she was not the
daughter of Thomas St. Clair and her supposed mother, but of one
Marion La Motte and Jacob Leviston, and that Mrs. St. Clair had
adopted her when a baby and passed her off as her own child, that
she might succeed to the title. Meanwhile Delmour by the death of
his elder brother succeeds to the title and estates forfeited by
the detected foundling, but instead of acting as Tennyson's Lord
Ronald does, he repudiates her and marries a duchess. But her
other lover Lyndsay is true to her and marries her. Delmour not
long afterwards dies without issue, and Lyndsay succeeds to the
title, Gertrude then becoming after all Countess of Rossville. In
details Tennyson follows the novel sometimes very closely. Thus
the "single rose," the poor dress, the bitter exclamation about
her being a beggar born, are from the novel.<br>
<br>
The 1842 and all editions up to and including 1850 begin with the
following stanza and omit stanza 2: &shy; <br>
<br>


<blockquote>Lord Ronald courted Lady Clare,<br>
 I trow they did not part in scorn;<br>
 Lord Ronald, her cousin, courted her<br>
 And they will wed the morrow morn.<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was the time when lilies blow,<br>
 And clouds are highest up in air,<br>
 Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe<br>
 To give his cousin Lady Clare.<br>
<br>
 I trow they did not part in scorn:<br>
 Lovers long-betroth'd were they:<br>
 They two will wed the morrow morn!<br>
 God's blessing on the day!<br>
<br>
 "He does not love me for my birth,<br>
 Nor for my lands so broad and fair;<br>
 He loves me for my own true worth,<br>
 And that is well," said Lady Clare.<br>
<br>
 In there came old Alice the nurse,<br>
 Said, "Who was this that went from thee?"<br>
 "It was my cousin," said Lady Clare,<br>
 "To-morrow he weds with me."<br>
<br>
 "O God be thank'd!" said Alice the nurse,<br>
 "That all comes round so just and fair:<br>
 Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,<br>
 And you are not the Lady Clare."<br>
<br>
 "Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse?"<br>
 Said Lady Clare, "that ye speak so wild";<br>
 "As God's above," said Alice the nurse,<br>
 "I speak the truth: you are my child.<br>
<br>
 "The old Earl's daughter died at my breast;<br>
 I speak the truth, as I live by bread!<br>
 I buried her like my own sweet child,<br>
 And put my child in her stead."<br>
<br>
 "Falsely, falsely have ye done,<br>
 O mother," she said, "if this be true,<br>
 To keep the best man under the sun<br>
 So many years from his due."<br>
<br>
 "Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,<br>
 "But keep the secret for your life,<br>
 And all you have will be Lord Ronald's,<br>
 When you are man and wife."<br>
<br>
 "If I'm a beggar born," she said,<br>
 <a name="fter"></a>"I will speak out, for I dare not lie.<br>
 Pull off, pull off, the broach  <a href="#fte">1</a>  of
gold,<br>
 And fling the diamond necklace by."<br>
<br>
 "Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,<br>
 "But keep the secret all ye can."<br>
 She said, "Not so: but I will know<br>
 If there be any faith in man".<br>
<br>
 "Nay now, what faith?" said Alice the nurse,<br>
 "The man will cleave unto his right."<br>
 <a name="ftfr"></a>"And he shall have it," the lady replied,<br>
 "Tho'  <a href="#ftf">2</a>  I should die to-night."<br>
<br>
 "Yet give one kiss to your mother dear!<br>
 Alas, my child, I sinn'd for thee."<br>
 "O mother, mother, mother," she said,<br>
 "So strange it seems to me.<br>
<br>
 "Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,<br>
 My mother dear, if this be so,<br>
 And lay your hand upon my head,<br>
 And bless me, mother, ere I go."<br>
<br>
 She clad herself in a russet gown,<br>
 She was no longer Lady Clare:<br>
 She went by dale, and she went by down,<br>
 With a single rose in her hair.<br>
<br>
 The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought<br>
 Leapt up from where she lay,<br>
 <a name="ftgr"></a>Dropt her head in the maiden's hand,<br>
 And follow'd her all the way.  <a href="#ftg">3</a><br>
<br>
 Down stept Lord Ronald from his tower:<br>
 "O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!<br>
 Why come you drest like a village maid,<br>
 That are the flower of the earth?"<br>
<br>
 "If I come drest like a village maid,<br>
 <a name="fthr"></a>I am but as my fortunes are:<br>
 I am a beggar born," she said,  <a href="#fth">4</a><br>
 "And not the Lady Clare."<br>
<br>
 "Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,<br>
 "For I am yours in word and in deed.<br>
 Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,<br>
 "Your riddle is hard to read."<br>
<br>
 O and proudly stood she up!<br>
 Her heart within her did not fail:<br>
 She look'd into Lord Ronald's eyes,<br>
 And told him all her nurse's tale.<br>
<br>
 He laugh'd a laugh of merry scorn:<br>
 He turn'd, and kiss'd her where she stood:<br>
 "If you are not the heiress born,<br>
 And I," said he, "the next in blood &shy;<br>
<br>
 "If you are not the heiress born,<br>
 And I," said he, "the lawful heir,<br>
 We two will wed to-morrow morn,<br>
 And you shall still be Lady Clare."</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section90">The Lord of Burleigh</a></h3>

<br>
Written, as we learn from <i>Life</i>, i., 182, by 1835. First
published in 1842. No alteration since with the exception of
"tho'" for "though".<br>
<br>
This poem tells the well-known story of Sarah Hoggins who married
under the circumstances related in the poem. She died in January,
1797, sinking, so it was said, but without any authority for such
a statement, under the burden of an honour "unto which she was
not born". The story is that Henry Cecil, heir presumptive to his
uncle, the ninth Earl of Exeter, was staying at Bolas, a rural
village in Shropshire, where he met Sarah Hoggins and married
her. They lived together at Bolas, where the two eldest of his
children were born, for two years before he came into the title.
She bore him two other children after she was Countess of Exeter,
dying at Burleigh House near Stamford at the early age of
twenty-four. The obituary notice runs thus: "January, 1797. At
Burleigh House near Stamford, aged twenty-four, to the
inexpressible surprise and concern of all acquainted with her,
the Right Honbl. Countess of Exeter." For full information about
this romantic incident see Walford's <i>Tales of Great
Families</i>, first series, vol. i., 65-82, and two interesting
papers signed W. O. Woodall in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, seventh
series, vol. xii., 221-23; <i>ibid</i>., 281-84, and Napier's
<i>Homes and Haunts of Tennyson</i>, 104-111.<br>


<blockquote>In her ear he whispers gaily,<br>
 "If my heart by signs can tell,<br>
 Maiden, I have watch'd thee daily,<br>
 And I think thou lov'st me well".<br>
 She replies, in accents fainter,<br>
 "There is none I love like thee".<br>
 He is but a landscape-painter,<br>
 And a village maiden she.<br>
 He to lips, that fondly falter,<br>
 Presses his without reproof:<br>
 Leads her to the village altar,<br>
 And they leave her father's roof.<br>
 "I can make no marriage present;<br>
 Little can I give my wife.<br>
 Love will make our cottage pleasant,<br>
 And I love thee more than life."<br>
 They by parks and lodges going<br>
 See the lordly castles stand:<br>
 Summer woods, about them blowing,<br>
 Made a murmur in the land.<br>
 From deep thought himself he rouses,<br>
 Says to her that loves him well,<br>
 "Let us see these handsome houses<br>
 Where the wealthy nobles dwell".<br>
 So she goes by him attended,<br>
 Hears him lovingly converse,<br>
 Sees whatever fair and splendid<br>
 Lay betwixt his home and hers;<br>
 Parks with oak and chestnut shady,<br>
 Parks and order'd gardens great,<br>
 Ancient homes of lord and lady,<br>
 Built for pleasure and for state.<br>
 All he shows her makes him dearer:<br>
 Evermore she seems to gaze<br>
 On that cottage growing nearer,<br>
 Where they twain will spend their days.<br>
 O but she will love him truly!<br>
 He shall have a cheerful home;<br>
 She will order all things duly,<br>
 When beneath his roof they come.<br>
 Thus her heart rejoices greatly,<br>
 Till a gateway she discerns<br>
 With armorial bearings stately,<br>
 And beneath the gate she turns;<br>
 Sees a mansion more majestic<br>
 Than all those she saw before:<br>
 Many a gallant gay domestic<br>
 Bows before him at the door.<br>
 And they speak in gentle murmur,<br>
 When they answer to his call,<br>
 While he treads with footstep firmer,<br>
 Leading on from hall to hall.<br>
 And, while now she wonders blindly,<br>
 Nor the meaning can divine,<br>
 Proudly turns he round and kindly,<br>
 "All of this is mine and thine".<br>
 Here he lives in state and bounty,<br>
 Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,<br>
 Not a lord in all the county<br>
 Is so great a lord as he.<br>
 All at once the colour flushes<br>
 Her sweet face from brow to chin:<br>
 As it were with shame she blushes,<br>
 And her spirit changed within.<br>
 Then her countenance all over<br>
 Pale again as death did prove:<br>
 But he clasp'd her like a lover,<br>
 And he cheer'd her soul with love.<br>
 So she strove against her weakness,<br>
 Tho' at times her spirits sank:<br>
 Shaped her heart with woman's meekness<br>
 To all duties of her rank:<br>
 And a gentle consort made he,<br>
 And her gentle mind was such<br>
 That she grew a noble lady,<br>
 And the people loved her much.<br>
 But a trouble weigh'd upon her,<br>
 And perplex'd her, night and morn,<br>
 With the burthen of an honour<br>
 Unto which she was not born.<br>
 Faint she grew, and ever fainter,<br>
 As she murmur'd "Oh, that he<br>
 Were once more that landscape-painter<br>
 Which did win my heart from me!"<br>
 So she droop'd and droop'd before him,<br>
 Fading slowly from his side:<br>
 Three fair children first she bore him,<br>
 Then before her time she died.<br>
 Weeping, weeping late and early,<br>
 Walking up and pacing down,<br>
 Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh,<br>
 Burleigh-house by Stamford-town.<br>
 And he came to look upon her,<br>
 And he look'd at her and said,<br>
 "Bring the dress and put it on her,<br>
 That she wore when she was wed".<br>
 Then her people, softly treading,<br>
 Bore to earth her body, drest<br>
 In the dress that she was wed in,<br>
 That her spirit might have rest.</blockquote>

first series, book ii., ballad vi.<br>

<blockquote>Her arms across her breast she laid;<br>
 She was more fair than words can say:<br>
 Bare-footed came the beggar maid<br>
 Before the king Cophetua.<br>
 In robe and crown the king stept down,<br>
 To meet and greet her on her way;<br>
 "It is no wonder," said the lords,<br>
 "She is more beautiful than day".<br>
<br>
 As shines the moon in clouded skies,<br>
 She in her poor attire was seen:<br>
 One praised her ancles, one her eyes,<br>
 One her dark hair and lovesome mien:<br>
 So sweet a face, such angel grace,<br>
 In all that land had never been:<br>
 Cophetua sware a royal oath:<br>
 "This beggar maid shall be my queen!"</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section94">The Vision of Sin</a></h3>

<br>
First published in 1842. No alteration made in it after 1851,
except in the insertion of a couplet afterwards omitted.<br>
<br>
This remarkable poem may be regarded as a sort of companion poem
to <i>The Palace of Art</i>; the one traces the effect of callous
indulgence in mere intellectual and aesthetic pleasures, the
other of profligate indulgence in the grosser forms of sensual
enjoyment. At first all is ecstasy and intoxication, then comes
satiety, and all that satiety brings in its train, cynicism,
pessimism, the drying up of the very springs of life.<br>


<blockquote>"The body chilled, jaded and ruined, the cup of
pleasure drained to the dregs, the senses exhausted of their
power to enjoy, the spirit of its wish to aspire, nothing left
but loathing, craving and rottenness."</blockquote>

<br>
 See Spedding in <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for April, 1843. The
poem concludes by leaving as an answer to the awful question,
"can there be final salvation for the poor wretch?" a reply
undecipherable by man, and dawn breaking in angry splendour. The
best commentary on the poem would be Byron's lyric: "There's not
a joy the world can give like that it takes away," and <i>Don
Juan</i>, biography and daily life are indeed full of comments on
the truth of this fine allegory.<br>
<br>


<blockquote><br>
 1<br>
<br>
 I had a vision when the night was late:<br>
 <a name="ftmr"></a>A youth came riding toward a palace-gate.<br>
 He rode a horse with wings, that would have flown,  <a href=
"#ftm">1</a><br>
 But that his heavy rider kept him down.<br>
 And from the palace came a child of sin,<br>
 And took him by the curls, and led him in,<br>
 Where sat a company with heated eyes,<br>
 Expecting when a fountain should arise:<br>
 A sleepy light upon their brows and lips &shy;<br>
 As when the sun, a crescent of eclipse,<br>
 Dreams over lake and lawn, and isles and capes &shy;<br>
 Suffused them, sitting, lying, languid shapes,<br>
 By heaps of gourds, and skins of wine, and piles of grapes.<br>
<br>
<br>
 2<br>
<br>
 <a name="ftnr"></a>Then methought I heard a mellow sound,<br>
 Gathering up from all the lower ground;  <a href=
"#ftn">2</a><br>
 Narrowing in to where they sat assembled<br>
 Low voluptuous music winding trembled,<br>
 Wov'n in circles: they that heard it sigh'd,<br>
 Panted hand in hand with faces pale,<br>
 Swung themselves, and in low tones replied;<br>
 Till the fountain spouted, showering wide<br>
 Sleet of diamond-drift and pearly hail;<br>
 Then the music touch'd the gates and died;<br>
 Rose again from where it seem'd to fail,<br>
 Storm'd in orbs of song, a growing gale;<br>
 Till thronging in and in, to where they waited,<br>
 As 'twere a hundred-throated nightingale,<br>
 The strong tempestuous treble throbb'd and palpitated;<br>
 Ran into its giddiest whirl of sound,<br>
 Caught the sparkles, and in circles,<br>
 Purple gauzes, golden hazes, liquid mazes,<br>
 Flung the torrent rainbow round:<br>
 Then they started from their places,<br>
 Moved with violence, changed in hue,<br>
 Caught each other with wild grimaces,<br>
 Half-invisible to the view,<br>
 Wheeling with precipitate paces<br>
 To the melody, till they flew,<br>
 Hair, and eyes, and limbs, and faces,<br>
 Twisted hard in fierce embraces,<br>
 Like to Furies, like to Graces,<br>
 Dash'd together in blinding dew:<br>
 Till, kill'd with some luxurious agony,<br>
 The nerve-dissolving melody<br>
 Flutter'd headlong from the sky.<br>
<br>
<br>
 3<br>
<br>
 And then I look'd up toward a mountain-tract,<br>
 That girt the region with high cliff and lawn:<br>
 I saw that every morning, far withdrawn<br>
 <a name="ftor"></a>Beyond the darkness and the cataract,<br>
 God made himself an awful rose of dawn,  <a href=
"#fto">3</a><br>
 Unheeded: and detaching, fold by fold,<br>
 From those still heights, and, slowly drawing near,<br>
 A vapour heavy, hueless, formless, cold,<br>
 Came floating on for many a month and year,<br>
 Unheeded: and I thought I would have spoken,<br>
 And warn'd that madman ere it grew too late:<br>
 But, as in dreams, I could not. Mine was broken,<br>
 When that cold vapour touch'd the palace-gate,<br>
 And link'd again. I saw within my head<br>
 A gray and gap-tooth'd man as lean as death,<br>
 Who slowly rode across a wither'd heath,<br>
 And lighted at a ruin'd inn, and said:<br>
<br>
<br>
 4<br>
<br>
 "Wrinkled ostler, grim and thin!<br>
 Here is custom come your way;<br>
 Take my brute, and lead him in,<br>
 Stuff his ribs with mouldy hay.<br>
<br>
 "Bitter barmaid, waning fast!<br>
 See that sheets are on my bed;<br>
 What! the flower of life is past:<br>
 It is long before you wed.<br>
<br>
 "Slip-shod waiter, lank and sour,<br>
 At the Dragon on the heath!<br>
 Let us have a quiet hour,<br>
 Let us hob-and-nob with Death.<br>
<br>
 "I am old, but let me drink;<br>
 Bring me spices, bring me wine;<br>
 I remember, when I think,<br>
 That my youth was half divine.<br>
<br>
 "Wine is good for shrivell'd lips,<br>
 When a blanket wraps the day,<br>
 When the rotten woodland drips,<br>
 And the leaf is stamp'd in clay.<br>
<br>
 "Sit thee down, and have no shame,<br>
 Cheek by jowl, and knee by knee:<br>
 What care I for any name?<br>
 What for order or degree?<br>
<br>
 "Let me screw thee up a peg:<br>
 Let me loose thy tongue with wine:<br>
 Callest thou that thing a leg?<br>
 Which is thinnest? thine or mine?<br>
<br>
 "Thou shalt not be saved by works:<br>
 Thou hast been a sinner too:<br>
 Ruin'd trunks on wither'd forks,<br>
 Empty scarecrows, I and you!<br>
<br>
 "Fill the cup, and fill the can:<br>
 Have a rouse before the morn:<br>

 Every moment one is born.  <a href="#ftp">4</a><br>

 Rising to no fancy-flies.<br>

 Bandied by the hands of fools.<br>

 Well I know, when I am gone,<br>
 How she mouths behind my back.<br>
<br>
 "Virtue! &shy; to be good and just &shy;<br>

 Mix'd with cunning sparks of hell.<br>

 "Greet her with applausive breath,<br>

<br>
 "Let her go! her thirst she slakes<br>
 Where the bloody conduit runs:<br>

 On the first-born of her sons.<br>
<br>
 "Drink to lofty hopes that cool &shy;<br>
 Visions of a perfect State:<br>
 Drink we, last, the public fool,<br>
 Frantic love and frantic hate.<br>
<br>
 "Chant me now some wicked stave,<br>
 Till thy drooping courage rise,<br>
 And the glow-worm of the grave<br>

<br>
 "Fear not thou to loose thy tongue;<br>

 Savours well to thee and me.<br>

 "Change, reverting to the years,<br>

 Dregs of life, and lees of man:<br>
 Yet we will not die forlorn."<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
 The voice grew faint: there came a further change:<br>
 Once more uprose the mystic mountain-range:<br>
 Below were men and horses pierced with worms,<br>
 And slowly quickening into lower forms;<br>
 By shards and scurf of salt, and scum of dross,<br>
 <a name="ftrr1"></a>Old plash of rains, and refuse patch'd with
moss,<br>
 Then some one spake  <a href="#ftr1">6</a> : "Behold! it was a
crime<br>
 <a name="ftsr"></a>Of sense avenged by sense that wore with
time".<br>
 <a href="#fts">7</a>  Another said: "The crime of sense
became<br>
 The crime of malice, and is equal blame".<br>
 And one: "He had not wholly quench'd his power;<br>
 A little grain of conscience made him sour".<br>
 At last I heard a voice upon the slope<br>
 Cry to the summit, "Is there any hope?"<br>
 To which an answer peal'd from that high land.<br>
 But in a tongue no man could understand;<br>
 <a name="fttr">And</a> on the glimmering limit far withdrawn<br>
 God made Himself an awful rose of dawn.  <a href=

inserted in Tennyson's <i>Life</i>, he says he once asked him for
some explanation of this line, and the poet's reply was:

<blockquote>"The power of explaining such concentrated
expressions of the imagination was very different from that of
writing them".</blockquote>

And on another occasion he said very happily:

<blockquote>"Poetry is like shot silk with many glancing colours.
Every reader must find his own interpretation, according to his
ability, and according to his sympathy with the
poet".</blockquote>

Poetry in its essential forms always suggests infinitely more
than it expresses, and at once inspires and kindles the
intelligence which is to comprehend it; if that intelligence,
which is perhaps only another name for sympathy, does not exist,
then, in Byron's happy sarcasm: &shy;

<blockquote>"The gentle readers wax unkind,<br>
 And, not so studious for the poet's ease,<br>
 Insist on knowing what he <i>means</i>, a hard<br>
 And hapless situation for a bard".</blockquote>

 Why the heavy oak groans, and the white willows sigh?<br>
 Why deep is not high, and high is not deep?<br>
 Whether we wake, or whether we sleep?<br>
 Whether we sleep, or whether we die?<br>
 How you are you? Why I am I?<br>
 Who will riddle me the <i>how</i> and the <i>why</i>?<br>
<br>
 The world is somewhat; it goes on somehow;<br>
 But what is the meaning of <i>then</i> and <i>now</i>?<br>
 I feel there is something; but how and what?<br>
 I know there is somewhat; but what and why?<br>
 I cannot tell if that somewhat be I.<br>
<br>
 The little bird pipeth, "why? why?"<br>
 In the summerwoods when the sun falls low<br>
 And the great bird sits on the opposite bough,<br>
 And stares in his face and shouts, "how? how?"<br>
 And the black owl scuds down the mellow twilight,<br>
 And chaunts, "how? how?" the whole of the night.<br>
<br>
 Why the life goes when the blood is spilt?<br>
 What the life is? where the soul may lie?<br>
 Why a church is with a steeple built;<br>
 And a house with a chimneypot?<br>
 Who will riddle me the how and the what?<br>
 Who will riddle me the what and the why?</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section103">Supposed Confessions...</a></h3>

<br>
<b>of a second-rate sensitive mind not in unity with
itself.</b><br>
<br>
There has been only one important alteration made in this poem,
when it was reprinted among the <i>Juvenilia</i> in 1871, and
that was the suppression of the verses beginning "A grief not
uninformed and dull" to "Indued with immortality" inclusive, and
the substitution of "rosy" for "waxen". Capitals are in all cases
inserted in the reprint where the Deity is referred to, "through"
is altered into "thro'" all through the poem, and hyphens are
inserted in the double epithets. No further alterations were made
in the edition of 1830.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>Oh God! my God! have mercy now.<br>
 I faint, I fall. Men say that thou<br>
 Didst die for me, for such as <i>me</i>,<br>
 Patient of ill, and death, and scorn,<br>
 And that my sin was as a thorn<br>
 Among the thorns that girt thy brow,<br>
 Wounding thy soul. &shy; That even now,<br>
 In this extremest misery<br>
 Of ignorance, I should require<br>
 A sign! and if a bolt of fire<br>
 Would rive the slumbrous summernoon<br>
 While I do pray to thee alone,<br>
 Think my belief would stronger grow!<br>
 Is not my human pride brought low?<br>
 The boastings of my spirit still?<br>
 The joy I had in my freewill<br>
 All cold, and dead, and corpse-like grown?<br>
 And what is left to me, but thou,<br>
 And faith in thee? Men pass me by;<br>
 Christians with happy countenances &shy;<br>
 And children all seem full of thee!<br>
 And women smile with saint-like glances<br>
 Like thine own mother's when she bow'd<br>
 Above thee, on that happy morn<br>
 When angels spake to men aloud,<br>
 And thou and peace to earth were born.<br>
 Goodwill to me as well as all &shy;<br>
 I one of them: my brothers they:<br>
 Brothers in Christ &shy; a world of peace<br>
 And confidence, day after day;<br>
 And trust and hope till things should cease,<br>
 And then one Heaven receive us all.<br>
 How sweet to have a common faith!<br>
 To hold a common scorn of death!<br>
 And at a burial to hear<br>
 The creaking cords which wound and eat<br>
 Into my human heart, whene'er<br>
 Earth goes to earth, with grief, not fear,<br>
 With hopeful grief, were passing sweet!<br>
<br>
 A grief not uninformed, and dull<br>
 Hearted with hope, of hope as full<br>
 As is the blood with life, or night<br>
 And a dark cloud with rich moonlight.<br>
 To stand beside a grave, and see<br>
 The red small atoms wherewith we<br>
 Are built, and smile in calm, and say &shy;<br>
 "These little moles and graves shall be<br>
 Clothed on with immortality<br>
 More glorious than the noon of day &shy;<br>
 All that is pass'd into the flowers<br>
 And into beasts and other men,<br>
 And all the Norland whirlwind showers<br>
 From open vaults, and all the sea<br>
 O'er washes with sharp salts, again<br>
 Shall fleet together all, and be<br>
 Indued with immortality."<br>
<br>
 Thrice happy state again to be<br>
 The trustful infant on the knee!<br>
 Who lets his waxen fingers play<br>
 About his mother's neck, and knows<br>
 Nothing beyond his mother's eyes.<br>
 They comfort him by night and day;<br>
 They light his little life alway;<br>
 He hath no thought of coming woes;<br>
 He hath no care of life or death,<br>
 Scarce outward signs of joy arise,<br>
 Because the Spirit of happiness<br>
 And perfect rest so inward is;<br>
 And loveth so his innocent heart,<br>
 Her temple and her place of birth,<br>
 Where she would ever wish to dwell,<br>
 Life of the fountain there, beneath<br>
 Its salient springs, and far apart,<br>
 Hating to wander out on earth,<br>
 Or breathe into the hollow air,<br>
 Whose dullness would make visible<br>
 Her subtil, warm, and golden breath,<br>
 Which mixing with the infant's blood,<br>
 Fullfills him with beatitude.<br>
 Oh! sure it is a special care<br>
 Of God, to fortify from doubt,<br>
 To arm in proof, and guard about<br>
 With triple-mailed trust, and clear<br>
 Delight, the infant's dawning year.<br>
<br>
 Would that my gloomed fancy were<br>
 As thine, my mother, when with brows<br>
 Propped on thy knees, my hands upheld<br>
 In thine, I listen'd to thy vows,<br>
 For me outpour'd in holiest prayer &shy;<br>
 For me unworthy! &shy; and beheld<br>
 Thy mild deep eyes upraised, that knew<br>
 The beauty and repose of faith,<br>
 And the clear spirit shining through.<br>
 Oh! wherefore do we grow awry<br>
 From roots which strike so deep? why dare<br>
 Paths in the desert? Could not I<br>
 Bow myself down, where thou hast knelt,<br>
 To th' earth &shy; until the ice would melt<br>
 Here, and I feel as thou hast felt?<br>
 What Devil had the heart to scathe<br>
 Flowers thou hadst rear'd &shy; to brush the dew<br>
 From thine own lily, when thy grave<br>
 Was deep, my mother, in the clay?<br>
 Myself? Is it thus? Myself? Had I<br>
 So little love for thee? But why<br>
 Prevail'd not thy pure prayers? Why pray<br>
 To one who heeds not, who can save<br>
 But will not? Great in faith, and strong<br>
 Against the grief of circumstance<br>
 Wert thou, and yet unheard. What if<br>
 Thou pleadest still, and seest me drive<br>
 Thro' utter dark a fullsailed skiff,<br>
 Unpiloted i' the echoing dance<br>
 Of reboant whirlwinds, stooping low<br>
 Unto the death, not sunk! I know<br>
 At matins and at evensong,<br>
 That thou, if thou were yet alive,<br>
 In deep and daily prayers wouldst strive<br>
 To reconcile me with thy God.<br>
 Albeit, my hope is gray, and cold<br>
 At heart, thou wouldest murmur still &shy;<br>
 "Bring this lamb back into thy fold,<br>
 My Lord, if so it be thy will".<br>
 Wouldst tell me I must brook the rod,<br>
 And chastisement of human pride;<br>
 That pride, the sin of devils, stood<br>
 Betwixt me and the light of God!<br>
 That hitherto I had defied<br>
 And had rejected God &shy; that grace<br>
 Would drop from his o'erbrimming love,<br>
 As manna on my wilderness,<br>
 If I would pray &shy; that God would move<br>
 And strike the hard hard rock, and thence,<br>
 Sweet in their utmost bitterness,<br>
 Would issue tears of penitence<br>
 Which would keep green hope's life. Alas!<br>
 I think that pride hath now no place<br>
 Nor sojourn in me. I am void,<br>
 Dark, formless, utterly destroyed.<br>
<br>
 Why not believe then? Why not yet<br>
 Anchor thy frailty there, where man<br>
 Hath moor'd and rested? Ask the sea<br>
 At midnight, when the crisp slope waves<br>
 After a tempest, rib and fret<br>
 The broadimbas&egrave;d beach, why he<br>
 Slumbers not like a mountain tarn?<br>
 Wherefore his ridges are not curls<br>
 And ripples of an inland mere?<br>
 Wherefore he moaneth thus, nor can<br>
 Draw down into his vexed pools<br>
 All that blue heaven which hues and paves<br>
 The other? I am too forlorn,<br>
 Too shaken: my own weakness fools<br>
 My judgment, and my spirit whirls,<br>
 Moved from beneath with doubt and fear.<br>
<br>
 "Yet" said I, in my morn of youth,<br>
 The unsunned freshness of my strength,<br>
 When I went forth in quest of truth,<br>
 "It is man's privilege to doubt,<br>
 If so be that from doubt at length,<br>
 Truth may stand forth unmoved of change,<br>
 An image with profulgent brows,<br>
 And perfect limbs, as from the storm<br>
 Of running fires and fluid range<br>
 Of lawless airs, at last stood out<br>
 This excellence and solid form<br>
 Of constant beauty. For the Ox<br>
 Feeds in the herb, and sleeps, or fills<br>
 The horned valleys all about,<br>
 And hollows of the fringed hills<br>
 In summerheats, with placid lows<br>
 Unfearing, till his own blood flows<br>
 About his hoof. And in the flocks<br>
 The lamb rejoiceth in the year,<br>
 And raceth freely with his fere,<br>
 And answers to his mother's calls<br>
 From the flower'd furrow. In a time,<br>
 Of which he wots not, run short pains<br>
 Through his warm heart; and then, from whence<br>
 He knows not, on his light there falls<br>
 A shadow; and his native slope,<br>
 Where he was wont to leap and climb,<br>
 Floats from his sick and filmed eyes,<br>
 And something in the darkness draws<br>
 His forehead earthward, and he dies.<br>
 Shall man live thus, in joy and hope<br>
 As a young lamb, who cannot dream,<br>
 Living, but that he shall live on?<br>
 Shall we not look into the laws<br>
 Of life and death, and things that seem,<br>
 And things that be, and analyse<br>
 Our double nature, and compare<br>
 All creeds till we have found the one,<br>
 If one there be?" Ay me! I fear<br>
 All may not doubt, but everywhere<br>
 Some must clasp Idols. Yet, my God,<br>
 Whom call I Idol? Let thy dove<br>
 Shadow me over, and my sins<br>
 Be unremembered, and thy love<br>
 Enlighten me. Oh teach me yet<br>
 Somewhat before the heavy clod<br>
 Weighs on me, and the busy fret<br>
 Of that sharpheaded worm begins<br>
 In the gross blackness underneath.<br>
<br>
 O weary life! O weary death!<br>
 O spirit and heart made desolate!<br>
 O damn&eacute;d vacillating state!</blockquote>

 Lost in its effulgence sleeps,<br>
 The lawless comets as they glare,<br>
 And thunder thro' the sapphire deeps<br>
 In wayward strength, are full of strange<br>

<h3><a name="section132">To &shy; &shy; ("My life is
full...")</a></h3>

<br>
When this poem was republished among the <i>Juvenilia</i> in 1871
several alterations were made in it. For the first stanza was
substituted the following: &shy; <br>
<br>


<blockquote>My life is full of weary days,<br>
 But good things have not kept aloof,<br>
 Nor wander'd into other ways:<br>
 I have not lack'd thy mild reproof,<br>
 Nor golden largess of thy praise.</blockquote>

<br>
 The second began "And now shake hands". In the fourth stanza for
"sudden laughters" of the jay was substituted the felicitous
"sudden scritches," and the sixth and seventh stanzas were
suppressed.<br>
<br>


<blockquote>I<br>
<br>
 All good things have not kept aloof<br>
 Nor wandered into other ways:<br>
 I have not lacked thy mild reproof,<br>
 Nor golden largess of thy praise.<br>
 But life is full of weary days.<br>
<br>
<br>
 II<br>
<br>
 Shake hands, my friend, across the brink<br>
 Of that deep grave to which I go:<br>
 Shake hands once more: I cannot sink<br>
 So far &shy; far down, but I shall know<br>
 Thy voice, and answer from below.<br>
<br>
<br>
 III<br>
<br>
 When in the darkness over me<br>
 The fourhanded mole shall scrape,<br>
 Plant thou no dusky cypresstree,<br>
 Nor wreathe thy cap with doleful crape,<br>
 But pledge me in the flowing grape.<br>
<br>
<br>
 IV<br>
<br>
 And when the sappy field and wood<br>
 Grow green beneath the showery gray,<br>
 And rugged barks begin to bud,<br>
 And through damp holts newflushed with May,<br>
 Ring sudden laughters of the Jay,<br>
<br>
<br>
 V<br>
<br>
 Then let wise Nature work her will,<br>
 And on my clay her darnels grow;<br>
 Come only, when the days are still,<br>
 And at my headstone whisper low,<br>
 And tell me if the woodbines blow.<br>
<br>
 VI<br>
<br>
 If thou art blest, my mother's smile<br>
 Undimmed, if bees are on the wing:<br>
 Then cease, my friend, a little while,<br>
 That I may hear the throstle sing<br>
 His bridal song, the boast of spring.<br>
<br>
<br>
 VII<br>
<br>
 Sweet as the noise in parch&egrave;d plains<br>
 Of bubbling wells that fret the stones,<br>
 (If any sense in me remains)<br>
 Thy words will be: thy cheerful tones<br>
 As welcome to my crumbling bones.</blockquote>

<br>
 The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallowed fruit,<br>
 Guard it well, guard it warily,<br>
 Singing airily,<br>
 Standing about the charm&egrave;d root.<br>
 Round about all is mute,<br>
 As the snowfield on the mountain-peaks,<br>
 As the sandfield at the mountain-foot.<br>
 Crocodiles in briny creeks<br>
 Sleep and stir not: all is mute.<br>
 If ye sing not, if ye make false measure,<br>
 We shall lose eternal pleasure,<br>
 Worth eternal want of rest.<br>
 Laugh not loudly: watch the treasure<br>
 Of the wisdom of the West.<br>
 In a corner wisdom whispers.<br>
 Five and three<br>
 (Let it not be preached abroad) make an awful mystery.<br>
 For the blossom unto three-fold music bloweth;<br>
 Evermore it is born anew;<br>
 And the sap to three-fold music floweth,<br>
 From the root<br>
 Drawn in the dark,<br>
 Up to the fruit,<br>
 Creeping under the fragrant bark,<br>
 Liquid gold, honeysweet thro' and thro'.<br>
 Keen-eyed Sisters, singing airily,<br>
 Looking warily<br>
 Every way,<br>
 Guard the apple night and day,<br>
 Lest one from the East come and take it away.<br>
<br>
<br>
 II<br>
<br>
 Father Hesper, Father Hesper, watch, watch, ever and aye,<br>
 Looking under silver hair with a silver eye.<br>
 Father, twinkle not thy stedfast sight;<br>
 Kingdoms lapse, and climates change, and races die;<br>
 Honour comes with mystery;<br>
 Hoarded wisdom brings delight.<br>
 Number, tell them over and number<br>
 How many the mystic fruittree holds,<br>
 Lest the redcombed dragon slumber<br>
 Rolled together in purple folds.<br>
 Look to him, father, lest he wink, and the golden apple be
stol'n away,<br>
 For his ancient heart is drunk with over-watchings night and
day,<br>
 Round about the hallowed fruit tree curled &shy;<br>
 Sing away, sing aloud evermore in the wind, without stop,<br>
 Lest his scal&egrave;d eyelid drop, For he is older than the
world.<br>
 If he waken, we waken,<br>
 Rapidly levelling eager eyes.<br>
 If he sleep, we sleep,<br>
 Dropping the eyelid over the eyes.<br>
 If the golden apple be taken<br>
 The world will be overwise.<br>
 Five links, a golden chain, are we,<br>
 Hesper, the dragon, and sisters three,<br>
 Bound about the golden tree.<br>

 Father Hesper, Father Hesper, watch, watch, night and day,<br>
 Lest the old wound of the world be healed,<br>
 The glory unsealed,<br>
 The golden apple stol'n away,<br>
 And the ancient secret revealed.<br>
 Look from west to east along:<br>
 Father, old Himala weakens,<br>
 Caucasus is bold and strong.<br>
 Wandering waters unto wandering waters call;<br>
 Let them clash together, foam and fall.<br>
 Out of watchings, out of wiles,<br>
 Comes the bliss of secret smiles.<br>

 Broken by the highland-steep,<br>
 Two streams upon the violet deep:<br>
 For the western sun and the western star,<br>
 And the low west wind, breathing afar,<br>
 The end of day and beginning of night<br>
 Make the apple holy and bright,<br>
 Holy and bright, round and full, bright and blest,<br>
 Mellowed in a land of rest;<br>
 Watch it warily day and night;<br>
 All good things are in the west,<br>
 Till midnoon the cool east light<br>
 Is shut out by the round of the tall hillbrow;<br>
 But when the fullfaced sunset yellowly<br>
 Stays on the flowering arch of the bough,<br>
 The luscious fruitage clustereth mellowly,<br>
 Goldenkernelled, goldencored,<br>
 Sunset-ripened, above on the tree,<br>
 The world is wasted with fire and sword,<br>
 But the apple of gold hangs over the sea,<br>
 Five links, a golden chain, are we,<br>
 Hesper, the dragon, and sisters three,<br>

<blockquote>My Rosalind, my Rosalind,<br>
 My frolic falcon, with bright eyes,<br>
 Whose free delight, from any height of rapid flight,<br>
 Stoops at all game that wing the skies,<br>
 My Rosalind, my Rosalind,<br>
 My bright-eyed, wild-eyed falcon, whither,<br>
 Careless both of wind and weather,<br>
 Whither fly ye, what game spy ye,<br>
 Up or down the streaming wind?<br>
<br>
<br>
 II<br>
<br>
 The quick lark's closest-carolled strains,<br>
 The shadow rushing up the sea,<br>
 The lightningflash atween the rain,<br>
 The sunlight driving down the lea,<br>
 The leaping stream, the very wind,<br>
 That will not stay, upon his way,<br>
 To stoop the cowslip to the plains,<br>
 Is not so clear and bold and free<br>
 As you, my falcon Rosalind.<br>
 You care not for another's pains,<br>
 Because you are the soul of joy,<br>
 Bright metal all without alloy.<br>
 Life shoots and glances thro' your veins,<br>
 And flashes off a thousand ways,<br>
 Through lips and eyes in subtle rays.<br>
 Your hawkeyes are keen and bright,<br>
 Keen with triumph, watching still<br>
 To pierce me through with pointed light;<br>
 And oftentimes they flash and glitter<br>
 Like sunshine on a dancing rill,<br>
 And your words are seeming-bitter,<br>
 Sharp and few, but seeming-bitter<br>
 From excess of swift delight.<br>
<br>
<br>
 III<br>
<br>
 Come down, come home, my Rosalind,<br>
 My gay young hawk, my Rosalind:<br>
 Too long you keep the upper skies;<br>
 Too long you roam, and wheel at will;<br>
 But we must hood your random eyes,<br>
 That care not whom they kill,<br>
 And your cheek, whose brilliant hue<br>
 Is so sparkling fresh to view,<br>
 Some red heath-flower in the dew,<br>
 Touched with sunrise. We must bind<br>
 And keep you fast, my Rosalind,<br>
 Fast, fast, my wild-eyed Rosalind,<br>
 And clip your wings, and make you love:<br>
 When we have lured you from above,<br>
 And that delight of frolic flight, by day or night,<br>
 From North to South;<br>
 We'll bind you fast in silken cords,<br>
 <a name="fuar">And</a> kiss away the bitter words<br>
 From off your rosy mouth.  <a href="#fua">1</a></blockquote>

 In the ear, from far and near,<br>
 Chimeth musically clear.<br>
 My falconhearted Rosalind,<br>
 Fullsailed before a vigorous wind,<br>
 Is one of those who cannot weep<br>
 For others' woes, but overleap<br>
 All the petty shocks and fears<br>
 That trouble life in early years,<br>
 With a flash of frolic scorn<br>
 And keen delight, that never falls<br>
 Away from freshness, self-upborne<br>
 With such gladness, as, whenever<br>
 The freshflushing springtime calls<br>
 To the flooding waters cool,<br>
 Young fishes, on an April morn,<br>
 Up and down a rapid river,<br>
 Leap the little waterfalls<br>
 That sing into the pebbled pool.<br>

<blockquote>Deep in that lion-haunted island lies A mystic city,
goal of enterprise. (Chapman.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks<br>
 The narrow seas, whose rapid interval<br>
 Parts Afric from green Europe, when the Sun<br>
 Had fall'n below th' Atlantick, and above<br>
 The silent Heavens were blench'd with faery light,<br>
 Uncertain whether faery light or cloud,<br>
 Flowing Southward, and the chasms of deep, deep blue<br>
 Slumber'd unfathomable, and the stars<br>
 Were flooded over with clear glory and pale.<br>
 I gaz'd upon the sheeny coast beyond,<br>
 There where the Giant of old Time infixed<br>
 The limits of his prowess, pillars high<br>
 Long time eras'd from Earth: even as the sea<br>
 When weary of wild inroad buildeth up<br>
 Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves.<br>
 And much I mus'd on legends quaint and old<br>
 Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth<br>
 Toward their brightness, ev'n as flame draws air;<br>
 But had their being in the heart of Man<br>
 As air is th' life of flame: and thou wert then<br>
 A center'd glory &shy; circled Memory,<br>
 Divinest Atalantis, whom the waves<br>
 Have buried deep, and thou of later name<br>
 Imperial Eldorado roof'd with gold:<br>
 Shadows to which, despite all shocks of Change,<br>
 All on-set of capricious Accident,<br>
 Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die.<br>
 As when in some great City where the walls<br>
 Shake, and the streets with ghastly faces throng'd<br>
 Do utter forth a subterranean voice,<br>
 Among the inner columns far retir'd<br>
 At midnight, in the lone Acropolis.<br>
 Before the awful Genius of the place<br>
 Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith, the while<br>
 Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks<br>
 Unto the fearful summoning without:<br>
 Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees,<br>
 Bathes the cold hand with tears, and gazeth on<br>
 Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith<br>
 Her phantasy informs them. Where are ye<br>
 Thrones of the Western wave, fair Islands green?<br>
 Where are your moonlight halls, your cedarn glooms,<br>
 The blossoming abysses of your hills?<br>
 Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays<br>
 Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds?<br>
 Where are the infinite ways which, Seraph-trod,<br>
 Wound thro' your great Elysian solitudes,<br>
 Whose lowest depths were, as with visible love,<br>
 Fill'd with Divine effulgence, circumfus'd,<br>
 Flowing between the clear and polish'd stems,<br>
 And ever circling round their emerald cones<br>
 In coronals and glories, such as gird<br>
 The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven?<br>
 For nothing visible, they say, had birth<br>
 In that blest ground but it was play'd about<br>
 With its peculiar glory. Then I rais'd<br>
 My voice and cried "Wide Afric, doth thy Sun<br>
 Lighten, thy hills enfold a City as fair<br>
 As those which starr'd the night o' the Elder World?<br>
 Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo<br>
 A dream as frail as those of ancient Time?"<br>
 A curve of whitening, flashing, ebbing light!<br>
 A rustling of white wings! The bright descent<br>
 Of a young Seraph! and he stood beside me<br>
 There on the ridge, and look'd into my face<br>
 With his unutterable, shining orbs,<br>
 So that with hasty motion I did veil<br>
 My vision with both hands, and saw before me<br>
 Such colour'd spots as dance athwart the eyes<br>
 Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun.<br>
 Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath<br>
 His breast, and compass'd round about his brow<br>
 With triple arch of everchanging bows,<br>
 And circled with the glory of living light<br>
 And alternation of all hues, he stood.<br>
<br>
 "O child of man, why muse you here alone<br>
 Upon the Mountain, on the dreams of old<br>
 Which fill'd the Earth with passing loveliness,<br>
 Which flung strange music on the howling winds,<br>
 And odours rapt from remote Paradise?<br>
 Thy sense is clogg'd with dull mortality,<br>
 Thy spirit fetter'd with the bond of clay:<br>
 Open thine eye and see." I look'd, but not<br>
 Upon his face, for it was wonderful<br>
 With its exceeding brightness, and the light<br>
 Of the great angel mind which look'd from out<br>
 The starry glowing of his restless eyes.<br>
 I felt my soul grow mighty, and my spirit<br>
 With supernatural excitation bound<br>
 Within me, and my mental eye grew large<br>
 With such a vast circumference of thought,<br>
 That in my vanity I seem'd to stand<br>
 Upon the outward verge and bound alone<br>
 Of full beautitude. Each failing sense<br>
 As with a momentary flash of light<br>
 Grew thrillingly distinct and keen. I saw<br>
 The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth,<br>
 The indistinctest atom in deep air,<br>
 The Moon's white cities, and the opal width<br>
 Of her small glowing lakes, her silver heights<br>
 Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud,<br>
 And the unsounded, undescended depth<br>
 Of her black hollows. The clear Galaxy<br>
 Shorn of its hoary lustre, wonderful,<br>
 Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light<br>
 Blaze within blaze, an unimagin'd depth<br>
 And harmony of planet-girded Suns<br>
 And moon-encircled planets, wheel in wheel,<br>
 Arch'd the wan Sapphire. Nay, the hum of men,<br>
 Or other things talking in unknown tongues,<br>
 And notes of busy life in distant worlds<br>
 Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear.<br>
 A maze of piercing, trackless, thrilling thoughts<br>
 Involving and embracing each with each<br>
 Rapid as fire, inextricably link'd,<br>
 Expanding momently with every sight<br>
 And sound which struck the palpitating sense,<br>
 The issue of strong impulse, hurried through<br>
 The riv'n rapt brain: as when in some large lake<br>
 From pressure of descendant crags, which lapse<br>
 Disjointed, crumbling from their parent slope<br>
 At slender interval, the level calm<br>
 Is ridg'd with restless and increasing spheres<br>
 Which break upon each other, each th' effect<br>
 Of separate impulse, but more fleet and strong<br>
 Than its precursor, till the eye in vain<br>
 Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade<br>
 Dappled with hollow and alternate rise<br>
 Of interpenetrated arc, would scan<br>
 Definite round.<br>
<br>
 I know not if I shape<br>
 These things with accurate similitude<br>
 From visible objects, for but dimly now,<br>
 Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream,<br>
 The memory of that mental excellence<br>
 Comes o'er me, and it may be I entwine<br>
 The indecision of my present mind<br>
 With its past clearness, yet it seems to me<br>
 As even then the torrent of quick thought<br>
 Absorbed me from the nature of itself<br>
 With its own fleetness. Where is he that borne<br>
 Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream,<br>
 Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge,<br>
 And muse midway with philosophic calm<br>
 Upon the wondrous laws which regulate<br>
 The fierceness of the bounding element?<br>
 My thoughts which long had grovell'd in the slime<br>
 Of this dull world, like dusky worms which house<br>
 Beneath unshaken waters, but at once<br>
 Upon some earth-awakening day of spring<br>
 Do pass from gloom to glory, and aloft<br>
 Winnow the purple, bearing on both sides<br>
 Double display of starlit wings which burn<br>
 Fanlike and fibred, with intensest bloom:<br>
 E'en so my thoughts, ere while so low, now felt<br>
 Unutterable buoyancy and strength<br>
 To bear them upward through the trackless fields<br>
 Of undefin'd existence far and free.<br>
<br>
 Then first within the South methought I saw<br>
 A wilderness of spires, and chrystal pile<br>
 Of rampart upon rampart, dome on dome,<br>
 Illimitable range of battlement<br>
 On battlement, and the Imperial height<br>
 Of Canopy o'ercanopied.<br>
<br>
 Behind,<br>
 In diamond light, upsprung the dazzling Cones<br>
 Of Pyramids, as far surpassing Earth's<br>
 As Heaven than Earth is fairer. Each aloft<br>
 Upon his narrow'd Eminence bore globes<br>
 Of wheeling suns, or stars, or semblances<br>
 Of either, showering circular abyss<br>
 Of radiance. But the glory of the place<br>
 Stood out a pillar'd front of burnish'd gold<br>
 Interminably high, if gold it were<br>
 Or metal more ethereal, and beneath<br>
 Two doors of blinding brilliance, where no gaze<br>
 Might rest, stood open, and the eye could scan<br>
 Through length of porch and lake and boundless hall,<br>
 Part of a throne of fiery flame, where from<br>
 The snowy skirting of a garment hung,<br>
 And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes<br>
 That minister'd around it &shy; if I saw<br>
 These things distinctly, for my human brain<br>
 Stagger'd beneath the vision, and thick night<br>
 Came down upon my eyelids, and I fell.<br>
<br>
 With ministering hand he rais'd me up;<br>
 Then with a mournful and ineffable smile,<br>
 Which but to look on for a moment fill'd<br>
 My eyes with irresistible sweet tears,<br>
 In accents of majestic melody,<br>
 Like a swol'n river's gushings in still night<br>
 Mingled with floating music, thus he spake:<br>
<br>
 "There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway<br>
 The heart of man: and teach him to attain<br>
 By shadowing forth the Unattainable;<br>
 And step by step to scale that mighty stair<br>
 <a name="fubr"></a>Whose landing-place is wrapt about with
clouds<br>
 Of glory of Heaven.  <a href="#fub">1</a>  With earliest Light
of Spring,<br>
 And in the glow of sallow Summertide,<br>
 And in red Autumn when the winds are wild<br>
 With gambols, and when full-voiced Winter roofs<br>
 The headland with inviolate white snow,<br>
 I play about his heart a thousand ways,<br>
 Visit his eyes with visions, and his ears<br>
 With harmonies of wind and wave and wood &shy;<br>
 Of winds which tell of waters, and of waters<br>
 Betraying the close kisses of the wind &shy;<br>
 And win him unto me: and few there be<br>
 So gross of heart who have not felt and known<br>
 A higher than they see: They with dim eyes<br>
 Behold me darkling. Lo! I have given thee<br>
 To understand my presence, and to feel<br>
 My fullness; I have fill'd thy lips with power.<br>
 I have rais'd thee nigher to the Spheres of Heaven,<br>
 Man's first, last home: and thou with ravish'd sense<br>
 Listenest the lordly music flowing from<br>
 Th'illimitable years. I am the Spirit,<br>
 The permeating life which courseth through<br>
 All th' intricate and labyrinthine veins<br>
 Of the great vine of Fable, which, outspread<br>
 With growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare,<br>
 Reacheth to every corner under Heaven,<br>
 Deep-rooted in the living soil of truth:<br>
 So that men's hopes and fears take refuge in<br>
 The fragrance of its complicated glooms<br>
 And cool impleached twilights. Child of Man,<br>
 See'st thou yon river, whose translucent wave,<br>
 Forth issuing from darkness, windeth through<br>
 The argent streets o' the City, imaging<br>
 The soft inversion of her tremulous Domes.<br>
 Her gardens frequent with the stately Palm,<br>
 Her Pagods hung with music of sweet bells.<br>
 Her obelisks of ranged Chrysolite,<br>
 Minarets and towers? Lo! how he passeth by,<br>
 And gulphs himself in sands, as not enduring<br>
 To carry through the world those waves, which bore<br>
 The reflex of my City in their depths.<br>
 Oh City! Oh latest Throne! where I was rais'd<br>
 To be a mystery of loveliness<br>
 Unto all eyes, the time is well nigh come<br>
 When I must render up this glorious home<br>
 To keen <i>Discovery</i>: soon yon brilliant towers<br>
 Shall darken with the waving of her wand;<br>
 Darken, and shrink and shiver into huts,<br>
 Black specks amid a waste of dreary sand,<br>
 Low-built, mud-wall'd, Barbarian settlement,<br>
 How chang'd from this fair City!"<br>
<br>
 Thus far the Spirit:<br>
 Then parted Heavenward on the wing: and I<br>
 Was left alone on Calpe, and the Moon<br>
 Had fallen from the night, and all was dark!</blockquote>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
